In this registered randomized double-blind sham-controlled crossover study, spread over four successive days, 50 TRD patients received 20 iTBS sessions applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The accelerated iTBS treatment procedure was found to be safe and resulted in immediate statistically signiﬁcant decreases in depressive symptoms regardless of order/type of stimulation (real/sham). While only 28% of the patients showed a 50% reduction of their initial Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score at the end of the two-week procedure, this response rate increased to 38% when assessed two weeks after the end of the sham-controlled iTBS protocol, indicating delayed clinical effects. Importantly, 30% of the responders were considered in clinical remission. We found no demographic predictors for response. Our ﬁndings indicate that only four days of accelerated iTBS treatment applied to the left DLPFC in TRD may lead to meaningful clinical responses within two weeks post stimulation.\n& 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is currently an evidence-based and accepted treatment option to treat patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (Lefaucheur et al., 2014). Since two decades, evidence of supremacy of rTMS over placebo stimulation is accumulating, and the most compelling data have been provided by large, multisite, and randomized sham-controlled trials including pharmacotherapy resisting MDD patients (O’Reardon et al., 2007; George et al., 2010). On the other hand, the effects sizes are rather limited and remission rates are relatively small (De Raedt et al., 2015). Comparing classical HF-rTMS treatment to sham, applying daily rTMS sessions averagely over 2–4 weeks, shows moderate effect sizes on depressive symptoms of 0.39 (Schutter, 2009) or 0.55 (Slotema et al.,\nn Correspondence to: Department of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology Ghent University, De Pintelaan 185 – 9000, Ghent, Belgium.\nE-mail address: chris.baeken@UGent.be (C. Baeken). 1 Equally contributing authors.\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2016.04.015 0165-0327/& 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n\n2010), depending on the meta-analysis. Generally, for left high frequency (HF) rTMS this yields an average rate of 29% responders in the active condition and 10% for sham (Berlim et al., 2014). Although the average rate of responders patients receiving active and sham right low frequency (LF) rTMS was respectively 38% and 15% in another meta-analysis (Berlim et al., 2013a), left HF-rTMS only received an A level of evidence in recent guidelines on the therapeutic use of rTMS (Lefaucheur et al., 2014). Notwithstanding that no meta-analyses have been carried out yet for accelerated designs (given the limited amount of available accelerated HFrTMS data), in a recent open – label study response rate was 43%, with 29% remission immediately following treatment (15 sessions administered over 2 days) (Holtzheimer et al., 2010), and 35% response and 15% remission after a placebo-controlled HF-rTMS crossover study (Baeken et al., 2013). Of note, as treatment resistant depression (TRD) may not be the primary indication for rTMS treatment and may negatively inﬂuence the clinical outcome (George and Post, 2011), it is important to mention that these patients were not all treatment resistant.\nThe optimization in stimulation parameters, using more\n\nR. Duprat et al. / Journal of Affective Disorders 200 (2016) 6–14\n\n7\n\naccurate methods to localize the stimulation area (Gershon et al., 2003; Fitzgerald et al., 2009; Levkovitz et al., 2015), and also introducing intensiﬁed or accelerated rTMS treatment algorithms have been evaluated to increase clinical responses, but seem to produce similar response rates (Baeken et al., 2013). For the latter, instead of the usually applied daily sessions, spread over two – to four weeks, accelerated stimulation protocols signiﬁcantly reduce the time-period of stimulation. In sum, accelerated HF-rTMS treatment protocols in MDD may be able to yield clinical improvements similar to the classic treatment protocols, but within a signiﬁcant shorter amount of time.\nRecently, a new form of rTMS has been introduced, i.e. thetaburst stimulation (TBS), thought to produce similar if not greater effects on brain activity than standard rTMS protocols. Recent data indeed suggest that TBS has similar or superior clinical efﬁcacy in treating MDD when compared to rTMS (Di Lazzaro et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2015; Prasser et al., 2015). Reduced administration duration may be a major advantage of TBS when compared to conventional rTMS procedures. Conventional TMS sessions may last between 20 and 45 min, while TBS paradigms may require less than 5 min of stimulation (Chung et al., 2015). Intermittent thetaburst stimulation (iTBS) uses bursts of high frequency stimulation at repeated intervals, usually on a 2 seconds on/8 seconds off cycle applying 50 Hz triplet bursts ﬁve times per second (Di Lazzaro et al., 2008; Bakker et al., 2015). Similar to HF-rTMS, iTBS may have excitatory effects on neurons, possibly matching or and exceeding the more classical HF-rTMS paradigms in antidepressant effectiveness (Di Lazzaro et al., 2011; Oberman et al., 2011; Bakker et al., 2015). Neurophysiological data suggest that iTBS affects cortical and subcortical neuroplasticity via long-term potentiation (Huang et al., 2005; Chistyakov et al., 2010). In theory, it may thus be possible that the strongest antidepressant effects may have a delayed onset. Interestingly, it has been suggested that TBS, at least the continuous form (cTBS), with effects comparable to the low frequency application of rTMS, may obey a dose-response function, suggesting that higher numbers of delivered stimuli may be needed to optimize clinical outcomes in MDD patients (Chistyakov et al., 2010). On the other hand, it has to be noted that the excitatory effects of iTBS may not be that straightforward, as prolonged iTBS sessions applied to the motor cortex in healthy individuals may result in inhibitory effects rather than excitation (Gamboa et al., 2010), although dose-dependent effects resulting in neuronal excitation have been reported as well (Nettekoven et al., 2014). Although at this stage no ﬁrm conclusion can be drawn, the effects of iTBS treatment may result in an even better clinical outcome than cTBS or rTMS (Li et al., 2014).\nBuilding further on our previous studies of accelerated HFrTMS (Baeken et al., 2013), the current crossover study aimed at investigating whether an accelerated iTBS treatment protocol (sham-controlled) could result in fast and meaningful beneﬁcial clinical effects in a group of TRD patients. Because we wanted not only to include ‘last resort’ TRD patients, all patients were considered at least stage I treatment resistant (Rush et al., 2003). To evaluate the immediate inﬂuences of iTBS, mood was assessed daily. To evaluate delayed clinical effects, all patients were assessed two weeks after the end of the (two week) protocol. Patients were randomized to receive in the ﬁrst week either 20 real or sham iTBS sessions (5 sessions/day), delivering a ﬁxed amount of pulses amounting in total 32.400 stimuli over 4 days’ time (1620 pulses per session). The choice for the prolonged iTBS parameters within a stimulation session was based on the rationale of delivering a similar amount of pulses - as we performed in our former accelerated HF-rTMS study (Baeken et al., 2013)-in order to compare the two neurostimulation protocols for clinical outcome, rather than examining the inhibitory or excitatory effects of prolonged iTBS.\n\nWe hypothesized that the application of this accelerated iTBS protocol would result in fast and meaningful clinical outcomes, especially so after the real when compared to the sham iTBS treatment sessions. Secondly, during the real iTBS sessions, we expected to detect signiﬁcant mood improvements even before the end of the 4-day stimulation protocol. Thirdly, given the possible large-scale neuroplasticity effects induced by iTBS, we expected that beneﬁcial clinical changes brought about by iTBS would survive and possibly even increase two weeks after the end of the treatment.\n2. Methods and materials\nThis registered study (http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/ NCT01832805) was approved by the local Ghent University Hospital ethics committee and in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki (2004). All patients gave written informed consent. This study was part of a larger project investigating the inﬂuence of iTBS on neuro-cognitive markers.2\n2.1. TRD patients\nFifty right-handed antidepressant-free depressed patients (35 females), age 42 years (SD ¼ 12), were included in the iTBS study.3 Depression was diagnosed using the structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al., 1998). All patients were at least stage I treatment resistant: they had a minimum of one unsuccessful treatment trial with serotonin reuptake inhibitors/ noradrenaline or serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI/ NSRI). For details see Table 1. Exclusion criteria were current or past history of epilepsy, neurosurgical interventions, having a pacemaker or metal or magnetic objects in the brain, having had electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), alcohol dependence and suicide attempts occurring within 6 months before the start of the study. Bipolar and psychotic depressed patients were excluded. Because concomitant antidepressant treatment can confound outcome results, all patients went through a medication washout before entering the study. All TRD patients were free from any antidepressant (AD), neuroleptic and mood stabilizer for at least two weeks before entering the iTBS treatment protocol. As proposed by Fitzgerald and Daskalakis (2012), only habitual benzodiazepine agents were allowed. In practice, the benzodiazepines were mostly prescribed as sleeping medication. The maximum allowed dose of benzodiazepines was the equivalent of 40 mg diazepam. These benzodiazepines equivalent doses are described by the British National Formulary (No. 66, London: British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain; September 2013, pp. 218–226). Any changes in benzodiazepine treatment during the stimulation sessions resulted in dropout from the\n2 Part of this data set, including 22 TRD patients, was also used in a conference paper reporting preliminary results on the effects of accelerated iTBS on suicidal ideation (Desmyter et al., 2014). Because of the speciﬁc literature concerning suicide, the complete results of this iTBS protocol on suicidal ideation will be published elsewhere.\n3 Given that an estimation of the expected effect size is necessary to calculate the power and that there are currently no studies available on which we can rely to estimate the effect size, we started from the assumption that we would be able to ﬁnd a clinically meaningful medium effect size, which corresponds to f ¼ .25 in an ANOVA (corresponds to d ¼.50). For the parallel design part of our study with within-between interaction to observe the effects at week one (2 pre-post X\n2 sham-real), with our total sample of 47 patients and the α error probability set at\n0.05, the power to ﬁnd an effect was.92 (calculated with G-Power 3.1.9.2.), which is very high. Even when we are very conservative and start from the meta-analysis of Schutter (2009) based on a regular rTMS intervention (as compared to our accelerated design with iTBS), in which a mean effect size d ¼ .39 was found (which corresponds to an f of.195 in ANOVA), the power of our study was 0.74.\n\n8\n\nR.

For the record, no patients dropped-out according this criterion.\nBecause of a severe suicide attempt (overdose of medication) in the weekend after one week of stimulation (sham iTBS), one female patient was considered dropout from the study. One male patient erroneously received two times real stimulation. Although he was responder at T2 and remitter at T4, we did not include his data into the ﬁnal analyses. Finally, after inclusion, one female patient spontaneously improved after her AD washout and it was decided not to start the stimulation protocol and no follow-up data were collected.\n\n2.2. Stimulation protocol\nIntermittent TBS stimulation was applied using a Magstim Rapid2 Plus1 magnetic stimulator (Magstim Company Limited, Wales, UK) with a ﬁgure-of eight-shaped coil. The Brainsight neuronavigation system (Brainsight™, Rogue Resolutions, Inc) was used to identify the site of stimulation ((i.e., the center part of the midprefrontal gyrus [Brodmann 9/46]) based on structural MRI of each individual in order to accurately target the left DLPFC. Before the ﬁrst session, the resting motor threshold (rMT) of each individual was determined using surface electromyography. Given the dose-dependency effect (Chistyakov et al., 2010), a stimulation intensity of 110% of the subject's rMT of the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle was used and this MT was maintained throughout\n\nFig. 1. Flow chart of the experimental iTBS treatment procedure. After a washout period, all patients are at least two weeks antidepressant (AD) free before they are randomized to receive real or sham iTBS treatment respectively. Baseline measurements were assessed at T1 (on Monday afternoon) before the ﬁrst week of iTBS treatment. iTBS treatment is spread over the four succeeding afternoons (5 daily sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday). In the second week, strictly the same treatment schedule is followed but with a change of stimulation: line AB ¼a TRD patient who ﬁrst received real iTBS now receives sham; line BA¼a patient who ﬁrst received sham treatment now receives real iTBS. A second assessment day is performed exactly 1 week after the ﬁrst week (time T2) and a third time exactly after 2 weeks (time T3), always on a Monday afternoon. No stimulation or assessment was performed during the weekend (WE). Two weeks after ﬁnishing the real iTBS week at T4 all measurements were reassessed.\n\nR. Duprat et al. / Journal of Affective Disorders 200 (2016) 6–14\n\n9\n\nthe experimental procedure. The treatment protocol consisting of in total 20 iTBS sessions was spread over 4 days at ﬁve sessions per day, mounting a total of 32.400 stimuli. See Fig. 1. In each session, patients received 1620 pulses per session in 54 triplet bursts with train duration of 2 seconds and an intertrain interval of 8 seconds. For the sham condition, a specially designed sham coil identical to the real coil was placed exactly on the same target/anatomical location in the same position, but without any active stimulation. Throughout the whole iTBS treatment (real and sham), patients were blindfolded, wore earplugs and were kept unaware of the type of stimulation they received. Between two sessions, there was a pause of approximately 15 min.\n2.3. Clinical assessment\nTo assess the short-term clinical effects of the sham-controlled iTBS treatment protocol three strategies were followed.\nFirst, to evaluate the effects of iTBS on (negative) mood after each week of stimulation, depression severity was assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; Hamilton, 1967) by a certiﬁed psychiatrist, blinded to the actual treatment of the patient. After the initial assessment at baseline (T1), patients were randomized (ﬂipping a coin) to receive in the ﬁrst week either real or sham iTBS delivered on the left DLPFC. All patients were re-assessed after 1 week of real or sham treatment (T2) and at the end of the second week of the stimulation protocol (T3). Following standard practice, we deﬁned clinical response as a 50% reduction of the baseline HDRS score. At each of these time points patients were also asked to score themselves on depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I; Beck et al., 1961) assessing how they felt over the previous week. To evaluate possible delayed clinical effects of accelerated iTBS, patients were reassessed two weeks after end of the protocol (T4). See Fig. 1. Within the two-week period, with the exception of the current benzodiazepine intake at steady dose, patients were psychotropic free and any change was considered as drop out of the study.\nSecondly, to detect acute changes on depression severity symptoms over 24 h on a daily basis we used an adapted version of the BDI-I so that patients scored themselves on depression symptoms over the last 24 h. This BDI-I 24 h was ﬁlled in before the start of each stimulation day (before the 5 iTBS sessions).\nThirdly, to evaluate immediate changes in mood on a daily basis, within the same day directly before and after each of the ﬁve daily iTBS sessions, mood ratings were administered using seven visual analogue scales (VAS) providing measures of fatigue, power, anger, cheerfulness, tension, depression, and happiness (McCormack et al., 1988). Patients were asked to describe from “totally not” to “very much” how they felt “at that moment” using 10 cm horizontal lines for each of the abovementioned mood states.\n3. Statistical analyses\nAll collected data were analyzed with SPSS 22 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Whenever the assumption of sphericity was violated, we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. The signiﬁcance level was set at po 0.05, two-tailed, for all analyses. Given the intention-to-treat protocol all analyses were completed by a last observation carry forward approach (LOCF) when applicable. See also Table 1.\nFirst, to examine the clinical effects of accelerated iTBS treatment on a weekly basis, we performed a mixed 2 Â 4 ANOVA with the depression severity scores (HDRS) at the 4 different clinical assessments as the dependent variable, and Time (T1 at baseline; T2 after the ﬁrst week of stimulation; T3 after the second week of\n\nstimulation, and T4 two weeks after the end of the stimulation protocol) and Order (ﬁrst sham then real vs. ﬁrst real then sham) as between-subjects factors. To follow-up signiﬁcant interaction effects, we anticipated to use separate Time (baseline; after stimulation) X Stimulation (real; sham) mixed ANOVA's separately for week 1 and 2 separately, followed by T-tests. A similar approach was performed with the BDI-I, indicating how they felt over the last week.\nSecondly, to evaluate the impact of 5 iTBS sessions over 24 h, a mixed 2 Â 2 Â 4 ANOVA was performed with an adapted version of the BDI-I over 24 h depression severity scores (BDI-I 24 h) assessed at the start of the 4 different stimulation days as dependent variable. Week (week 1 vs. week 2) and Day (T1 day one; T2 day two; T3 day three; T4 day four) were the within-subjects factors and Order (ﬁrst sham then real vs. ﬁrst real then sham iTBS) the between-subjects factor. This was also followed by T-tests to further examine signiﬁcant effects.\nThirdly, to examine whether the daily iTBS sessions affected mood without any delay, when mood was measured with VAS, mood changes were analyzed with a mixed 2 Â 2 Â 4 MANOVA. Within-subject factors were Week (week 1 vs. week 2) and Day (T1, T2, T3 and T4). The between subjects factor was Order (ﬁrst real then sham vs. ﬁrst sham then real iTBS). Signiﬁcant results would be followed-up by T-tests. The seven VAS mood scales were the multiple dependent variables. On every stimulation day before and after each individual session every VAS subscale was assessed 6 times. For each stimulation day, mean values were calculated for each VAS subscale separately at T1, T2, T3, and T4.\nFourthly, to examine whether demographic and individual physiological data predicted clinical outcome we used two approaches. 1) With a categorical approach (only with the 17-item HDRS), we wanted to identify baseline group differences between responders and non-responders (clinical response deﬁned as a 50% reduction of the baseline HDRS score) at T4 at the end of the entire iTBS protocol (2 weeks after T3). We ran separate analyses for Gender (dichotomous), age, duration of the current depressive episode (years), subtype of depression diagnosis (melancholic/ non-melancholic), level of treatment-resistance (Stage I, II, and III), and individual differences in motor threshold. When appropriate, we applied independent T or X2 tests with the same variables (See also Table 1). 2) To substantiate the relationship between changes in depressive symptoms and individual features we used stepwise linear regression analysis (probability-of-F-to-enter r 0.05, probability-of-F-to-remove Z0.10), adopting a continuous approach with HDRS change scores. We calculated the clinical change as delta HDRS (HDRS scores at baseline T1 – HDRS scores two weeks after the procedure (T4)). Then, we used this score as dependent variable. Gender (dichotomous), age, duration of the current depressive episode and individual differences in motor threshold were the independent predictors. A similar approach was performed with the delta BDI-I.\n4. Results\nAlthough the iTBS treatment was found to be safe and generally well tolerated, a majority of patients, especially at the start of the ﬁrst session, mentioned some discomfort such as superﬁcial pain sensations at the stimulation site, or headache. These complaints spontaneously disappeared after a short period of time or shortly after the intake of a common analgesic such as paracetamol.\nGiven the three drop-out patients, we performed all analyses on the remaining 47 patients. Twenty-ﬁve participants ﬁrst received sham then real iTBS treatment during the second week, while 22 TRD patients had the opposite order. Mean HDRS scores before entering the study at baseline (T1) were 21.34 (SD ¼5.26),\n\n10\n\nR. Duprat et al. / Journal of Affective Disorders 200 (2016) 6–14\n\nindicating moderate to severe depression. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1.\nAccording to the deﬁnition of clinical response, from the 47 included patients at the end of the two-week study protocol (T3) 13 were identiﬁed as clinical responders (28%), with only 7 in remission (15%) deﬁned as a 17-item HDRS (scorer 7). However, two weeks after the iTBS trial (T4) the amount of clinical responders (n ¼18) increased to 38%. Fourteen patients were considered in remission at T4 (30%).\nFrom the 22 patients who received real iTBS in the ﬁrst week, 4 were considered to be in response at T2 (18%). Convinced of having had real stimulation, only one Stage II female patient out of 25 (4%) responded to the ﬁrst week of placebo iTBS (HDRS from T1: 24 to T2: 10) and further reaching remission at T3 (HDRS: 7) and at T4 (HDRS: 7). Four patients responded after the second week of real iTBS, and another 3 after the second week of sham treatment. Two male patients who responded after real iTBS at T2 were above the 50% response threshold again at T3 and remained at these scores at T4, and did not meet the criteria for clinical response. One female patient was considered responder after the second week of stimulation (real iTBS, HDRS: 10), but 2 weeks later at T4 she was clinically depressed again (HDRS: 23). All other patients who responded at T3 remained responder or were remission at T4.\nAlthough baseline HDRS and BDI-I were not correlated r ¼ 0.24, n¼ 47, p ¼0.11, the clinical changes (Δ HDRS, Δ BDI-I) after the two week iTBS procedure were signiﬁcantly correlated: at T3 (HDRS T3-HDRS T1 and BDI-I T3 – BDI-I T1) r ¼ 0.67, n ¼ 44, p o 0.01 and at T4 (HDRS T4-HDRS T1 and BDI-I T4 – BDI-I T1) r ¼ 0.69, n ¼ 43, p o0.01. Due to some missing BDI-I values, the number of included patients varied across time points. A LOCF approach including 45 patients did not inﬂuence this outcome.\n4.1. Clinical effects of accelerated iTBS treatment on depression severity on a weekly basis\nThe 4 (Time) x 2 (Order) ANOVA with the HDRS scores as dependent variable showed a signiﬁcant main effect of Time F(3, 41) ¼23.57, p o0.01, but not of Order F(1, 43) ¼0.54, p ¼0.47. Importantly, the two-way interaction between Time and Order was not signiﬁcant F(3, 41) ¼1.36, p¼ 0.27, suggesting that the order of stimulation had little to no impact on clinical improvements as a function of time. The signiﬁcant main effect of time showed linear decreases on the 17-item HDRS scores over time, suggesting that the accelerated iTBS procedure, regardless whether it was real or sham, was associated with signiﬁcant improvement regarding depression severity. See Fig. 2. Using the individual BDI-I scores as dependent variable, a similar outcome was evidenced: a signiﬁcant main effect of Time F(3, 38) ¼10.36, p o0.01, but not of Order F(1, 40) ¼0.01, p ¼0.93 and no signiﬁcant two-way interaction between these two factors was observed F(3, 38) ¼0.88, p ¼0.46. Due to missing data, 42 TRD patients were included (22 received ﬁrst real). A LOCF analysis including 45 patients (22 received ﬁrst real) did not inﬂuence this outcome. Of note, when performing a 2 (Time: pre/post) x 2 (Intervention: real/sham) ANOVA, to examine the effects of one week of real and one week of sham iTBS, but this time between subjects, again we observed a signiﬁcant main effect of Time F(1, 45) ¼19.14, p o0.01, not of Order F(1, 45)¼ 1.05, p¼ 0.31 and not for the two-way interaction between Time and Order F(1, 45) ¼ 1.79, p¼ 0.19. A similar outcome we found with the BDI-I.\n4.2. Clinical effects of accelerated iTBS treatment on depression severity over 24 h\nTo evaluate the iTBS clinical effects over 24 h (BDI-I 24 h) the mixed ANOVA with Week (week 1 vs. week 2) and Day (T1 day\n\nFig. 2.

The two-way interactions between Week and Order F(1, 40) ¼0.12, p ¼0.73, between Day and Order F(3, 120) ¼2.36, p¼ 0.08, and between Week and Time were not signiﬁcant F(3, 120) ¼0.77, p ¼0.51. The three-way interaction between Week, Day, and Order was not signiﬁcant either, F(3, 120) ¼ 0.46, p ¼0.71. Due to missing data, 42 TRD patients were included (22 received ﬁrst real). A LOCF approach with 43 patients (22 received ﬁrst real) did not inﬂuence this outcome. Paired T-tests (LOCF) did not show signiﬁcant differences between the 2 different week and days (p's 40.05).\n4.3. Immediate daily clinical effects of accelerated iTBS treatment on mood\nThe mixed MANOVA evaluating the immediate iTBS effects on mood (VAS) showed a marginal signiﬁcant main effect of Week F (7, 36) ¼2.04, p ¼0.08, but no signiﬁcant main effect of Day F(21, 366) ¼0.81, p ¼0.71 or of Order F(7, 36) ¼0.76, p ¼0.62. The interaction effects between Week and Order F(7, 36) ¼ 0.76, p¼ 0.62, between Day and Order F(21, 366) ¼0.42, p ¼0.99, and between Week and Day F(21, 366) ¼1.23, p ¼0.22 were not signiﬁcant either. Furthermore, the interaction effect between Week, Day and Order was not signiﬁcant F(21, 366) ¼1.11, p ¼0.33. See Table 2. Of note, mixed ANOVAs performed for each VAS subscale separately did not show any signiﬁcant effects, neither real nor sham iTBS therapy.\n4.4. Demographic inﬂuences on clinical outcome of accelerated iTBS treatment\nFor the categorical approach, Pearson Chi-Square tests showed no signiﬁcant association between responders/non-responders and Gender X2(47) ¼ 0.80, p ¼0.37, Order X2(47) ¼0.07, p¼ 0.80, hospitalization/ ambulatory treatment X2(47) ¼0.43, p ¼0.51, benzodiazepine intake (yes/no) X2(47) ¼0.23, p ¼0.63, type of depression (melancholic/non-melancholic) X2(47) ¼0.51, p ¼0.48, or Staging (I, II, III) X2(47) ¼ 1.70, p ¼ 0.43.\n\nR.

For three chronically depressed patients (one Stage I, one Stage II and one stage III) no clear-cut point of timing of current depressive episode could be established as they claimed to be depressed over the last 20 years or longer and they did not remember episodes of feeling better or less severely depressed. Therefore, we decided to exclude these patients from these analyses concerning depression duration. Nevertheless, we found no signiﬁcant differences of duration of the current depressive episode between responders and non-responders T(42) ¼1.42, p ¼0.16. Of note, one-way ANOVA's did not show signiﬁcant group differences between the 3 groups (Staging I, II, and III) (p′s 40.05) for the number of episodes, the age of the ﬁrst episode, the duration of the current episode, rMT, BDI-I at T1, except for HDRS at T1 F(2, 46) ¼3.53, p¼ 0.04. Bonferroni corrected T-tests showed that Stage III patients scored signiﬁcantly higher on 17-item HDRS than Stage I TRD patients (p ¼0.04).\nFinally, for the continuous approach, the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis for delta HDRS did not identify any of the variables as signiﬁcant predictor. This was the same for the delta BDI-I. LOCF approaches did not change these outcomes.\n5. Discussion\nGiven that the majority of the iTBS studies typically use (sub) threshold stimulation intensities (% MT of 100% or less) (Oberman et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2015), this iTBS study shows that suprathreshold iTBS is safe, and it can even be applied several times a day with short time intervals between sessions. No seizures or any other major adverse events were observed. Minor transient complaints such as fatigue and headache were reported mainly after the ﬁrst treatment sessions, but none required medical attention.\nConcerning the overall clinical improvements, this study showed no statistical signiﬁcant differential effects between sham and real stimulation on depression severity symptoms, assessed with the 17-HDRS and the BDI-I on a weekly basis. Moreover, no differential immediate mood changes occurred during the iTBS\n\nsessions when examined on a daily basis (VAS, BDI-I 24 h). Overall, these results are in line with our former accelerated HF-rTMS treatment protocol (Baeken et al., 2013), also using a within subjects sham-controlled crossover design, performing in total 20 sessions of suprathreshold HF-rTMS spread over 4 days performed 5 times daily (yielding a similar amount of pulses). Indeed, at the group level all TRD patients experienced clinical improvement to some extent, regardless of order, real/sham stimulation, substantiating our former ﬁndings that such accelerated protocols may be prone to stronger placebo effects (Baeken et al., 2013). Regardless of the stimulation protocol, accelerated protocols with several sessions a day, providing a lot of time, care, and attention to the patients may accumulate to a stronger placebo effect. Placebo responses in neurostimulation designs are not uncommon, also following the more classic sham-controlled rTMS studies offering daily treatment over weeks (Berman et al., 2000). The daily VAS results also agree with recent ﬁndings of an accelerated HFrTMS study where over a 3-day period of 3 daily stimulation sessions yielding up to 54.000 stimuli in total, 20 patients were allocated to real stimulation and 21 allocated to receive sham HFrTMS (George et al., 2014). These authors could also not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences between the two groups on the VAS measurements. Unlike inventories or questionnaires like the HDRS or BDI, it has been claimed that VAS used to detect mood change may not be sensitive enough to capture discrete moods changes caused by rTMS (George et al., 1996). Nevertheless, our daily assessment on depression severity symptoms (BDI-I 24 h) also did not indicate that the application of real or sham iTBS immediately changed the patient's impression of feeling less or more depressed.\nImportantly, and also in line with our former accelerated HFrTMS study (Baeken et al., 2013), when using a categorical approach - deﬁning clinical response by as a 50% decrease following treatment of the initial 17-item HDRS score À 26% of the TRD patients were considered to be clinical responders after the twoweek iTBS treatment protocol (at T3). Although this number seems somewhat modest and numerically lower than our former accelerated HF-rTMS treatment study (in which 35% of these TRD patients responded after the two-week procedure), the follow-up assessment showed increases in clinical response rising to 38% at T4. Importantly, conﬁrming our former ﬁndings, with these kinds of accelerated treatment protocols a vast number of patients (30%) were considered to be in remission (17-item HDRS scores r7). In the Hadley et al., (2011) study, a comparable proportion of MDD patients (i.e., 33%) showed remission after one week of HF-rTMS\n\n12\n\nR. Duprat et al. / Journal of Affective Disorders 200 (2016) 6–14\n\ntreatment (delivering 34.000 stimuli spread over 5 daily sessions). Furthermore, in the Holtzheimer trial (2010) 36% of the responders also were found to be in remission 3 weeks post last stimulation. Therefore, our current study adds to these ﬁndings by showing that the meaningful clinical effects resulting from the accelerated iTBS treatment performed over 4 days may actually occur later in time, indicating a possible delayed plasticity as a function of iTBS. This latter interpretation is not at odds with the proposed neurophysiological effects of TBS where it is assumed that this kind of neurostimulation may create more potent neuroplasticity effects, which may become apparent later in time following the treatment (Chung et al., 2015). We note however that brain imaging or neurophysiological studies will be needed to conﬁrm these assumptions. Using an intensiﬁed HF-rTMS protocol, Hadley and colleagues (2011) who delivered daily 6800 stimuli/session and 34.000 stimuli in 5 days (which is comparable to the number of stimulation reached here), encouraged their patients to carry on with this protocol for at least ﬁve weeks. After 8 weeks of treatment, 66% of the total sample of patients showed clinical remission. Although this was an open add-on to psychopharmacotherapy as usual study, these observations suggest indirectly that more potent clinical improvements may be obtained when accelerated stimulation is used during several weeks.\nThe current study did not conﬁrm our previous ﬁnding of a predictive effect of a younger age and a shorter depressive period as predictors of beneﬁcial outcome of accelerated HF-rTMS treatment (Baeken et al., 2013). Moreover, none of the demographic variables considered in our study turned out to explain (in part) the variance accounting for the distinction between responders and non-responders, nor clinical outcome more generally. Accordingly, these ﬁndings do not support the assumption that beneﬁcial neuroplasticity effects created by rTMS are especially visible in (relatively) younger patients (George and Post, 2011), and/or with a relatively short current depressive episode, or lower level of treatment resistance (Holtzheimer et al., 2004; Brakemeier et al., 2007). One could argue that compared to our previous study (Baeken et al., 2013), including only Stage III melancholic TRD patients, the current sample may have been more heterogeneous, with MDD patients showing different degrees of treatment resistance. We note however that neither depression staging nor the type of depression appeared to inﬂuence reliably the rate of clinical response in the current study. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that discrepant or sometimes opposite results were previously reported in the literature regarding the modulatory role (or the lack thereof) of demographic variables on TBS treatment efﬁcacy in MDD patients. With some studies reporting a deleterious or hindering effects with increasing levels of treatment resistance (Li et al., 2014), while other studies failed to evidence signiﬁcant contributions of variables such as therapy resistance, age, or duration of the current depressive episode as predictors (Plewnia et al., 2014). At any rate, it seems therefore parsimonious to conclude tentatively that clinical improvements in MDD resulting from an accelerated iTBS treatment may eventually be different (in either magnitude or content, or both) from the beneﬁcial effects brought about by more classical iTBS/HF-rTMS protocols.\nSome limitations warrant comments nonetheless. First, one major limitation is the lack of long-term follow-up data. By design, the T4 time point represents different duration of delay from real treatment across the two groups, thus essentially preventing direct comparison (See Fig. 1). Another important limitation is related to the possibility that patients were actually aware of real vs. sham stimulations and thus not completely blind to these two different conditions. Although we took great care to minimize this possibility (including the use of a coil in the sham condition that was allegedly identical to the one used for the real stimulation\n\ncondition, blindfolding and sound attenuation by means of earplugs), the sham condition necessarily differs from the real iTBS condition regarding skin sensations for example, a difference which may become especially obvious (for the patients) when using a crossover design like in the present case. Although not formally assessed, patients gave us such feedback. Despite the theoretical assumption that in contrast to a parallel group design, a crossover study comparing the same participants before versus after the intervention is not ‘contaminated’ by the variability between subjects - since the comparison is carried out on each individual - increasing dramatically study power, for our study it could have accounted for a disadvantage. For this accelerated iTBS study, we anticipated long term clinical effects meaning that the effect of a stimulation condition given in the ﬁrst time period persists into the second period. However, possible delayed clinical effects of real iTBS when applied during the ﬁrst week could only be measured at week two. For patients who received real stimulation during the second week, the delayed effects could not be measured. Secondly, although Berlim et al., (2013b) in a metaanalysis reported no signiﬁcant differences between depressed patients who after treatment correctly guessed their actual condition allocation (real or sham rTMS) and those who did not, in our study it was clear that a majority of patients were eventually aware of this skin sensation difference across the two conditions, as reported at the subjective level. Given the speciﬁcities of (accelerated) TBS designs, this problem might even be more salient with these designs than those based on (more standard) rTMS protocols. Lastly, as it is currently unclear whether the separate iTBS sessions applied on the left DLPFC in TRD patients evoked excitatory or inhibitory neuronal activity under the stimulation coil and/or in the connected regions, or even whether the net effect of the total accelerated iTBS treatment is predominantly excitatory or inhibitory, neurophysiological measures are needed to verify this inﬂuence on our results.\nIn conclusion, in spite that mood-related improvements may partly be explained by a placebo effect, nevertheless, accelerated iTBS treatment resulted in “fast” meaningful clinical responses with some delayed effect. The fact that the clinical effects of accelerated iTBS are comparable to those of accelerated HF-rTMS, which was recently conﬁrmed in studies comparing directly these two neurostimulation techniques (Bakker et al., 2015), is promising because it paves the way for using an effective neurostimulation protocol to treat MDD patients, which is less time consuming than more regular rTMS ones. In this context, additional empirical (and clinical) work is needed to optimize these parameters during iTBS (e.g., stimulation frequency, number of cycles, duration) and eventually improve further clinical outcomes in MDD. To ascertain the speciﬁcity of the neuroplasticity effects created by accelerated iTBS and providing in turn protective mechanisms against MDD, the use of crossover experimental designs incorporating a proper sham condition appears as a ‘conditio sine qua non’.\nAuthor disclosure\nNone.\nRole of funding source There were no commercial or ﬁnancial involvements relevant to this study (a\nfull ﬁnancial disclosure has been included with the submission, and is included in this document).\nThis work was supported by the Ghent University Multidisciplinary Research Partnership “The integrative neuroscience of behavioral control”.
