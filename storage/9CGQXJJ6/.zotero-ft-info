Title:          Neuroimaging Correlates of Treatment Response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Bipolar Depression: A Systematic Review
Subject:        Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become a promising strategy for bipolar disorder (BD). This study reviews neuroimaging findings, indicating functional, structural, and metabolic brain changes associated with TMS in BD. Web of Science, Embase, Medline, and Google Scholar were searched without any restrictions for studies investigating neuroimaging biomarkers, through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), in association with response to TMS in patients with BD. Eleven studies were included (fMRI = 4, MRI = 1, PET = 3, SPECT = 2, and MRS = 1). Important fMRI predictors of response to repetitive TMS (rTMS) included higher connectivity of emotion regulation and executive control regions. Prominent MRI predictors included lower ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity and lower superior frontal and caudal middle frontal volumes. SPECT studies found hypoconnectivity of the uncus/parahippocampal cortex and right thalamus in non-responders. The post-rTMS changes using fMRI mostly showed increased connectivity among the areas neighboring the coil. Increased blood perfusion was reported post-rTMS in PET and SPECT studies. Treatment response comparison between unipolar depression and BD revealed almost equal responses. Neuroimaging evidence suggests various correlates of response to rTMS in BD, which needs to be further replicated in future studies.
