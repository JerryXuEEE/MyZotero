To elucidate task-related neural dynamics, we study trained recurrent neural networks. We develop a mean field theory for reservoir computing networks trained to have multiple fixed point attractors. Our main result is that the dynamics of the network’s output in the vicinity of attractors is governed by a low-order linear ordinary differential equation. The stability of the resulting equation can be assessed, predicting training success or failure. As a consequence, networks of rectified linear units and of sigmoidal nonlinearities are shown to have diametrically different properties when it comes to learning attractors. Furthermore, a characteristic time constant, which remains finite at the edge of chaos, offers an explanation of the network’s output robustness in the presence of variability of the internal neural dynamics. Finally, the proposed theory predicts state-dependent frequency selectivity in the network response. \n \n    Figure \n    Figure  \n \n    Received 18 December 2015 \n \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.258101 \n \n© 2017 American Physical Society \nPhysics Subject Headings (PhySH) \n \n    Physical Systems  \n \nArtificial neural networks \n \n    Techniques  \n \nMachine learning Mean field theory \nNetworks \nAuthors & Affiliations \n \nAlexander Rivkind 1,2,* and Omri Barak 1,2,† \n \n    1 Faculty of Medicine, Technion–Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel \n    2 Network Biology Research Laboratories, Technion–Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel \n \n    * arivkind@tx.technion.ac.il \n    † omri.barak@gmail.com \n \nClick to Expand \nArticle Text \nClick to Expand \nSupplemental Material \nClick to Expand \nReferences \nClick to Expand \nIssue \n \nVol. 118, Iss. 25 — 23 June 2017 \nReuse & Permissions \n \n    The analysis of a trained RNN is shown for representative cases compliant with the fading memory property ().
