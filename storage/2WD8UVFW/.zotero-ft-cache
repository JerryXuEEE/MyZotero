A continuous-time dynamic model of a network of N nonlinear elements interacting via random asym-

~ metric couplings is studied. A self-consistent mean-field theory, exact in the N

limit, predicts a

transition from a stationary phase to a chaotic phase occurring at a critical value of the gain parameter.

The autocorrelations of the chaotic flow as well as the maximal Lyapunov exponent are calculated.

Theoretical investigations of the onset and the nature

of chaotic flows in deterministic dynamical systems have
focused, in recent years, mainly on systems with few degrees of freedom. ' Quite often chaos is achieved in these systems by the variation of a parameter through a se-
quence of bifurcation points, which represent increasing complexity of the motion. It is still an open question

whether these scenarios are realized in large systems which cannot be described by a small number of collective modes. In this Letter we study the nature of chaotic
— flows in a deterministic nonlinear system a neural — network consisting of many localized degrees of free-
dom. We show that in the limit of infinite number of degrees of freedom, there is a sharp transition (as a function of the parameter of nonlinearity) from a stationary state to a chaotic flow. This transition as well as the sta-

tistical properties of the chaotic flow is described by time-dependent self-consistent mean-field theory. The

maximal Lyapunov exponent is derived from the fluctuations about the mean-field solutions. In the context of
neurobiology, the study of chaos in neural networks may be relevant to the understanding of the appearance of spontaneous irregular patterns of activity in neural as-

semblies.

Here J;J is the synaptic efficacy which couples the output of the (presynaptic) jth neuron to the input of the (post-
synaptic) ith neuron, and J;; =0. In electrical terms Eqs.

(2) are II'irchhoff equations in which the left-hand side

represents the current leakage due to the membrane ca-

pacitance; the first term in the right-hand side represents

the current through the membrane resistance and the

last term denotes the input current flowing to the cell

due to the activity of the other cells. For simplicity the

microscopic time constant has been set equal to unity.

We consider here networks with random synaptic cou-
plings. Each of the JJ's is an independent random vari-

able which can be assumed for convenience to have a

Gaussian distribution. The mean of J;J is zero whereas
the variance is [J;ilJ=J /N. With this normalization

the intensive parameter in the case of (1) is the dimen-

sionless gain parameter gJ.
If the synaptic matrix J were symmetric then Eqs. (2)

would describe a relaxation of a global energy function,

which for random couplings is just a spin-glass Hamil-

tonian. Here we study synaptic matrices where J;i and Ji; are uncorrelated in which case the dynamics in gen-

eral is nonrelaxational. In this case the long-time behav-

N~ ~ ior may depend on the particular realization of the J~'s.

However, in the limit

a well defined typical

behavior exists, the properties of which are described

below.

The long-time properties of the solutions of Eqs. (2)

for large N have been studied by the method of the dynamical mean-field theory (MFT) originally devel-

oped for spin-glasses. This theory is exact in the limit

~. of N

The essential result of this MFT is quite

simple. The dynamics of the system at long times can be

there exists a value Ai(gJ) such that for d (0) in the regime 0 &5(0) &Ai, V(A) has the form shown in Fig.

Which of the many solutions correspond to stable at-

x- lim in(x'(r))/2r.

In the case of a stable point, k is negative. If the attrac-
tor is a stable limit cycle or quasiperiodic, k should be zero. On the other hand, in the case of a chaotic attractor X is positive indicating the exponential growth of a perturbation of the initial condition in random directions.

ing the instability of this fixed point when gJ & 1. The

static "spin-glass" fixed point also has a negative W, i.e.,

a positive X (for all gJ & 1), implying that it is not a

stable fixed point.

The analysis of Eq. (10) for a time-dependent h(t) is

more complicated. However, by differentiation of Eq.
(6) it is readily seen that y(t) =h(t) is an eigenstate of Eq. (10) with E=O. This state represents a fluctuation

of the initial condition in the direction of the flow. In the

case of oscillatory A(t), the zero-energy eigenstate is

part of a band of eigenvalues extending to negatiue energies, leading again to a positive Lyapunov exponent. '

In the case of the chaotic solution, W(t) is a sym-
metric potential well with a single tninimum at t=0.

The zero-energy solution is a bound state with an odd
wave function, y(t) =h(t), which has a single node, y(0) =0. Thus there is exactly one bound state, the

ground state, with negative energy yielding a positive X

as expected for a chaotic flow. We thus conclude that

the chaotic solution is the only stable solution of the

MFT for gJ & 1. ' Solving Eq. (10) for the chaotic

2-e solution near gJ=1 one finds that
ishes continuously as e=—gJ —1 0.

products of random matrices. '

An important question is how many positive Lyapunov
exponents appear above gJ=I. The distribution of the
I Lyapunov exponents cannot be evaluated from (t).

However, the fact that the exponential divergence of X (t) with time is observed in the theory even after the

limit N eo has been taken indicates that the number

of positive Lyapunov exponents for gJ & 1 is macroscop-

ic, i.e., proportional to N.

To what extent do the above predictions correspond to

the typical behavior of a system with a finite, large value

of N? To check this point we have solved Eqs. (2) nu-
merically for systems with sizes up to N =1000. A de-

tailed account of the simulations will be given elsewhere.

The most important novel feature of the numerical re-

sults is the existence of an intermediate regime of gJ

~ separating the stationary and the chaotic phases. For
sizes N 100, in almost all cases, a rapid decay to a
zero fixed point is observed for gJ&1, whereas for
gJ &2 the behavior is chaotic. However, as gJ is in-

creased above unity one first observes the appearance of

either nonzero stationary states, or more often, limited

cycles. These limited cycles become increasingly more

complex as gJ is increased until the motion becomes

chaotic. The limit cycles vary strongly from one realiza-
tion of J to another and are therefore probably not relat-

ed directly to the unstable periodic solutions of the MFT.

In fact, comparing the behavior of diH'erent system sizes

we find that the range of gJ where this intermediate be-

havior is observed shrinks as N increases. It therefore

seems that a system with a finite number of degrees of

freedom N undergoes a transition from a stationary state

to chaos through intermediate stages of limit cycles with

increasing complexity. However, the range of gJ where

~ these bifurcations occur shrinks to zero with N so that in

the limit N

a sharp transition to chaos emerges as

predicted by the MFT.

Several intriguing questions remain to be answered.

First, the above proposed picture for the behavior of

large finite systems has yet to be systematically tested.

In addition, further characterization of the strange at-

tractor, e.g., evaluation of the whole distribution of

Lyapunov exponents, is needed. Finally, it will be very

interesting to study extensions of the present model to

networks with short range synapti-c matrices in finite

spatial dimensions. Detailed presentation of the calcula-

tions will be given elsewhere.
