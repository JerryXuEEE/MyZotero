A self-consistent mean-field theory, exact in the N\n\nlimit, predicts a\n\ntransition from a stationary phase to a chaotic phase occurring at a critical value of the gain parameter.\n\nThe autocorrelations of the chaotic flow as well as the maximal Lyapunov exponent are calculated.\n\nPACS numbers: 05.45.+b, 05.20.—y, 47.20.Tg, 87. 10.+e\n\nTheoretical investigations of the onset and the nature\n\nof chaotic flows in deterministic dynamical systems have\nfocused, in recent years, mainly on systems with few degrees of freedom. ' Quite often chaos is achieved in these systems by the variation of a parameter through a se-\nquence of bifurcation points, which represent increasing complexity of the motion. It is still an open question\n\nwhether these scenarios are realized in large systems which cannot be described by a small number of collective modes. In this Letter we study the nature of chaotic\n— flows in a deterministic nonlinear system a neural — network consisting of many localized degrees of free-\ndom. We show that in the limit of infinite number of degrees of freedom, there is a sharp transition (as a function of the parameter of nonlinearity) from a stationary state to a chaotic flow. This transition as well as the sta-\n\ntistical properties of the chaotic flow is described by time-dependent self-consistent mean-field theory. The\n\nmaximal Lyapunov exponent is derived from the fluctuations about the mean-field solutions. In the context of\nneurobiology, the study of chaos in neural networks may be relevant to the understanding of the appearance of spontaneous irregular patterns of activity in neural as-\n\nsemblies.\n\n~ ( The model\n(\"neurons\")\n\nconsists\nfS;(t)I,\n\nof N localized\ni =1, . . . , N,\n\nwchoenrteinuo—us1\n\nvariables\nS; 1.\n\nAssociated with each neuron, a local field h;,\n\n+~, & h; &\n\nis defined through the relationship S;(t)\n\n=|Ii(h;(t)) where p(x) is a nonlinear gain function\n\nwhich defines the input (h;) -output (S;) characteristics\n\nof the neurons.

The vanishing of\nthe (\"steady state\") equal-time correlations implies that\n: the system (2) flows to the zero fixed point [h;—0}, for\n\nall (or almost all) initial conditions.

For gJ & 1 the form of V(A)\n\nis not unique but depends on the assumed magnitude of\n\nA(0). Furthermore, for a given V(h) there is a continu-\n\num of self-consistent solutions of Eq. (6). In general\n\nthere exists a value Ai(gJ) such that for d (0) in the regime 0 &5(0) &Ai, V(A) has the form shown in Fig.\n\n1(b). For such a potential the solutions of Eq.

This exponent, which measures the\n\nsensitivity of the flow to a perturbation of the initial con-\n\n\" ditions in a random direction, is given by the asymptotic\ntime dependence Z (t), i.e.,\n\nx- lim in(x'(r))/2r.\n\n(9)\n\nIn the case of a stable point, k is negative. If the attrac-\ntor is a stable limit cycle or quasiperiodic, k should be zero. On the other hand, in the case of a chaotic attractor X is positive indicating the exponential growth of a perturbation of the initial condition in random directions.\nCalculating the fluctuations about the MFT we find that x (r) can be written as\n\ng Z'(r) = Z„exp(2ro„r ), n=o\nr & 0, with ro„= —I + (1 E„)'i2—, where E„are the ei-\ngenvalues of the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation,\n\n) ( e'/ar -' a'V/a-~') y„(r) =E„y.(r),\nand E„+~ E„.

The\n\nstatic \"spin-glass\" fixed point also has a negative W, i.e.,\n\na positive X (for all gJ & 1), implying that it is not a\n\nstable fixed point.\n\nThe analysis of Eq. (10) for a time-dependent h(t) is\n\nmore complicated. However, by differentiation of Eq.\n(6) it is readily seen that y(t) =h(t) is an eigenstate of Eq. (10) with E=O. This state represents a fluctuation\n\nof the initial condition in the direction of the flow. In the\n\ncase of oscillatory A(t), the zero-energy eigenstate is\n\npart of a band of eigenvalues extending to negatiue energies, leading again to a positive Lyapunov exponent. '\n\nIn the case of the chaotic solution, W(t) is a sym-\nmetric potential well with a single tninimum at t=0.\n\nThe zero-energy solution is a bound state with an odd\nwave function, y(t) =h(t), which has a single node, y(0) =0. Thus there is exactly one bound state, the\n\nground state, with negative energy yielding a positive X\n\nas expected for a chaotic flow. We thus conclude that\n\nthe chaotic solution is the only stable solution of the\n\nMFT for gJ & 1. ' Solving Eq.

To check this point we have solved Eqs. (2) nu-\nmerically for systems with sizes up to N =1000. A de-\n\ntailed account of the simulations will be given elsewhere.\n\nThe most important novel feature of the numerical re-\n\nsults is the existence of an intermediate regime of gJ\n\n~ separating the stationary and the chaotic phases. For\nsizes N 100, in almost all cases, a rapid decay to a\nzero fixed point is observed for gJ&1, whereas for\ngJ &2 the behavior is chaotic. However, as gJ is in-\n\ncreased above unity one first observes the appearance of\n\neither nonzero stationary states, or more often, limited\n\ncycles. These limited cycles become increasingly more\n\ncomplex as gJ is increased until the motion becomes\n\nchaotic. The limit cycles vary strongly from one realiza-\ntion of J to another and are therefore probably not relat-\n\ned directly to the unstable periodic solutions of the MFT.\n\nIn fact, comparing the behavior of diH'erent system sizes\n\nwe find that the range of gJ where this intermediate be-\n\nhavior is observed shrinks as N increases. It therefore\n\nseems that a system with a finite number of degrees of\n\nfreedom N undergoes a transition from a stationary state\n\nto chaos through intermediate stages of limit cycles with\n\nincreasing complexity. However, the range of gJ where\n\n~ these bifurcations occur shrinks to zero with N so that in\n\nthe limit N\n\na sharp transition to chaos emerges as\n\npredicted by the MFT.\n\nSeveral intriguing questions remain to be answered.\n\nFirst, the above proposed picture for the behavior of\n\nlarge finite systems has yet to be systematically tested.\n\nIn addition, further characterization of the strange at-\n\ntractor, e.g., evaluation of the whole distribution of\n\nLyapunov exponents, is needed. Finally, it will be very\n\ninteresting to study extensions of the present model to\n\nnetworks with short range synapti-c matrices in finite\n\nspatial dimensions. Detailed presentation of the calcula-\n\ntions will be given elsewhere.\n\nSpecial thanks to P. C. Hohenberg for most valuable\n\ndiscussions. We have also benefitted from discussions\n\nwith D.
