Invasive intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) remains the clinical gold standard to investigate the nature of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) before surgical resection. However, there are major limitations of iEEG, such as the limited spatial sampling and the degree of subjectivity inherent in the analysis and clinical interpretation of iEEG data. Recent advances in network analysis and dynamical network modeling provide a novel aspect toward a more objective assessment of the EZ. The advantage of such approaches is that they are data-driven and require less or no human input. Multiple studies have demonstrated success using these approaches when applied to iEEG data in characterizing the EZ and predicting surgical outcomes. However, the limitations of iEEG recordings equally apply to these studies—limited spatial sampling and the implicit assumption that iEEG electrodes, whether strip, grid, depth or stereo EEG (sEEG) arrays, are placed in the correct location. Therefore, it is of interest to clinicians and scientists to see whether the same analysis and modeling techniques can be applied to whole-brain, non-invasive neuroimaging data (from MRI-based techniques) and neurophysiological data (from MEG and scalp EEG recordings), thus removing the limitation of spatial sampling, while safely and objectively characterizing the EZ. This review aims to summarize current state of the art non-invasive methods that inform epilepsy surgery using network analysis and dynamical network models. We also present perspectives on future directions and clinical applications of these promising approaches.\nKeywords: dynamical network models, non-invasive, EEG, MEG, epilepsy, epilepsy surgery\n1. INTRODUCTION\nEpilepsy is a debilitating neurological disorder that aﬀects 1–2% of the population worldwide (1). About two thirds of epilepsy patients may have their seizures controlled using anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), while at least one third of patients do not adequately respond to medications (2, 3). More crucially, this ratio of pharmaco-refractory patients has not changed with the introduction of new ﬁrst-line AEDs each year (4). For those pharmaco-refractory patients, surgical intervention (with the removal of brain tissue driving ictogenesis) can serve as a viable option for the treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy (5).\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n1\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\nCao et al.\n\nDynamical Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\n\nThe success rate of epilepsy surgery is between 30 and 70% (6, 7). A recent multi-center study suggests the success rate of epilepsy surgery is about 50% (8). While the role of epilepsy surgery is well-established, the estimated ratio of operated to potentially eligible patients is only 1:25–50 (9). Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ)— the minimum brain area to be removed to render a patient seizure free—is the ultimate goal in the pre-surgical evaluation of these patients (5, 10). Invasive intracranial monitoring (with direct recordings of local ﬁeld potentials generated by pathological brain tissue) is still the gold standard to delineate the EZ presurgically (1, 5, 6). However, it is not a true gold standard because intracranial recordings have multiple key limitations (11). These include high cost, signiﬁcant patient morbidity, and the element of subjectivity involved in the identiﬁcation of the iEEG-deﬁned seizure onset zone (SOZ) (8, 11). The analysis of ictal iEEG is typically restricted to visual inspection; however, a more objective approach to the analysis of iEEG data is beginning to emerge in the clinical setting (12–14). For instance, a number of investigators have developed quantitative approaches (12–14) to the analysis of clinical EEG to reduce the degree of subjectivity involved in the clinical interpretation of these complex datasets. Of the various forms of iEEG (classical sEEG, isolated depth electrodes, intraoperative monitoring, subdural grids, and strips), it is sEEG (with its more extensive sampling capacity) that has fostered a deeper understanding of the network nature of the EZ, challenging the clinical view that the EZ is a discrete unifocal zone.\nNetwork analysis and network models have assumed important roles in the present-day imaging of brain networks and their functions (15–17). As a fast-evolving research area, the recent advances in network analysis and network models enable the study of both normal and pathological brain dynamics by taking into account high-dimensional information obtained using neurophysiological and neuroimaging approaches (18–20). Aided by techniques from neuroscience and neuroimaging, a large number of studies using network analysis and network models have shed new light on our understanding of the enormous complexity of the epileptic brain (21).\nDynamical network models provide great capacity to probe the mechanisms underlying complex neural dynamics (15, 17, 22, 23). Inspired by pioneering studies of excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as the alpha rhythm of the thalamus (24–26), investigators have developed dynamical models of neural mass and neural mass networks, which connect an ensemble of neural mass models into macroscopic neural systems (27, 28). Employing dynamical network models, multiple attempts have been made to understand the mechanisms underlying normal and pathological neural dynamics (29– 34). Dynamical network models have also been applied to neurophysiological data recorded from the human brain to develop speciﬁc hypotheses toward clinical application (20, 29, 31, 35, 36). In this review, recent advances and notable developments in the ﬁeld will be examined in the context of epilepsy surgery.\n\n2. A GENERIC WORKFLOW\nA generic workﬂow of applying network analysis and dynamical network models to EEG and MEG source signals is depicted in Figure 1. EEG and MEG signals acquired as part of the presurgical evaluation are ﬁrst preprocessed via multiple steps before they are source modeled (37). After preprocessing, the head model and source space are constructed using the individual’s MRI data. Forward and inverse solutions are then generated for source imaging. Source signals in deﬁned source space can be then reconstructed. With reconstructed source signals, functional networks can be constructed using connectivity approaches.\nNetwork modeling generally requires a connectivity analysis to obtain a network structure or topology as the basis of the modeling as the ﬁrst step. This network structure may come from structural imaging data such as tractography or functional connectivity. When using functional connectivity to determine network structure, a series of time-evolving functional networks may be used (19) or a time-domain averaged functional network may be used. Some models also oﬀer the capacity to use directional networks and hence eﬀective connectivity and causal relationships may be integrated into the network structure (33, 38). Nodal level neural dynamics can then be embedded into network nodes. Multiple models of neural dynamics using diﬀerent mathematical mechanisms can be employed in this step. Some models also oﬀer ﬂexibility by accommodating the use of diﬀerent models to conﬁgure nodal neural dynamics. Network simulations can then be run with or without external inputs, such as perturbatory white noise. By introducing external noise, “stimulation,” or change in parameters, models can eﬀect a transition from non-seizure states to seizure states (39–42).\nEach model generates a probability map that depicts the likelihood of brain areas being responsible for interictal or ictal source activity depending on the nature and the assumptions that a method or model employs. Such probability maps can then be used to assess the concordance level with resection bed. Using concordance levels and post-surgical outcomes, the performance of models and approaches can be tested. Two patient examples are given in Figure 2.\n3. FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL NETWORKS IN FOCAL EPILEPSY\nWith ongoing advances in neuroimaging techniques, highresolution functional and structural neuroimaging data can be obtained from epilepsy patients for assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and research. Connectivity methods have commonly been used to construct functional and structural networks using neuroimaging data. This subsection discusses ﬁndings from studies using functional and structural connectivity and problems and limitations associated with connectivity analysis in epilepsy.\n3.1. Structural Networks in Focal Epilepsy\nWhen studying functional brain networks, an intuitive question to ask is how structural networks constrain functional\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n2\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\nCao et al.\n\nDynamical Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\n\nFIGURE 1 | A generic workﬂow. EEG and MEG signals are acquired for presurgical evaluation. Preprocessing of EEG and MEG signals is often required before source modeling to remove artifacts. The head model and the co-registered source space are then prepared using individual structural MRI data to generate a forward solution. Inverse solutions can be then generated using forward solutions and EEG/MEG signals. Using inverse solutions, source activity can be localized and reconstructed. Next, functional networks can be constructed using source signals and dynamical network models can be applied to identify brain areas that are responsible for ictal or interictal discharges. Dynamical network models can be then clinically validated against surgical resection margins linked to histology and post-surgical outcome.\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n3\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\nCao et al.\n\nDynamical Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\n\nFIGURE 2 | Examples of applying dynamical network models to non-invasive (MEG) and invasive (iEEG) data to identify brain areas that are responsible for ictogenesis. Three approaches are applied to MEG and iEEG data, respectively, to identify brain areas that are responsible for seizure generation (red highlight). These areas are then compared against the resection margin and surgical outcomes to validate the results of employed approaches. The Sync approach uses synchronizability and control centrality (19) to identify nodes that increase or decrease of the stability of the synchronous states of the network. AEC-VIZ and MI-VIZ represent the ictogenic zone identiﬁed using virtual iEEG signals reconstructed by ictal MEG and dynamical network models. Amplitude Envelope Correlation (AEC) and Mutual Information (MI) can be used to construct functional networks that are then fed to dynamical network models. Here, a Theta model is used to simulate ictal waveforms and a virtual resection technique to estimate the inﬂuence of each node on ictogenicity. The Epileptogenicity Index (EI) (43) estimates spectral and temporal features of ictal iEEG signals and provides a quantitative measure to identify epileptogenic areas. iEEG SOZ is the conventional clinical analysis of ictal iEEG signals to identify iEEG electrodes where seizures arise. For both patients, brain areas involved in epileptogenesis identiﬁed by noninvasive dynamical approaches are comparable to the areas identiﬁed by traditional invasive intracranial means. Both patients had an Engel 1 outcome—Patient 1 (left) had focal cortical dysplasia Type 1 and Patient 2 (right) had post-infectious cortical gliosis.\n\nnetworks. MRI techniques and structural connectivity have been introduced to address this. MRI techniques are widely used in clinical workup to localize pathological brain regions and understand epileptogenesis (1, 44). Diﬀusion MRI (dMRI) is a variant of standard MRI and one of the mainstream structural imaging techniques (45).\nIn a typical connectivity analysis, a standard MRI scan is required to capture an individual’s neuroanatomical structure. Analytical software, such as Freesurfer (46), can be used to segregate the whole brain into subregions based on a standard brain atlas or customized boundaries (47, 48). With dMRI, software that tracks ﬁber density or integrity can be then used to detect, count and quantitatively characterize ﬁbers that communicate between parcelated brain regions. This ﬁber density analysis results in a two-dimensional connectivity matrix, representing how strongly subregions are interconnected via white matter. This two-dimensional connectivity matrix may become a “ﬁngerprint” of an individual’s structural networks. Properties of the individualized connectivity matrix may characterize critical features of a pathological brain (49, 50). Early studies using dMRI and connectivity analysis suggest a change in structural connectivity in the epileptogenic zone and surrounding brain regions in focal epilepsy (44, 51, 52).\n\nMore speciﬁcally, in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients, structural alterations were reported in the epileptogenic zone in frontal and temporal lobes, but particularly at the temporal poles. These structural alterations revealed by tractography and connectivity analysis indicate distinct unilateral features and speciﬁc impacts on global structural connectivity (52). Despite variance introduced by individual diﬀerences and heterogeneous pathologies in group-level analysis, studies comparing TLE patients and healthy cohorts demonstrate extensive weakened temporo-parietal connections in TLE structural networks, which support the clinical observation of cognitive impairment in memory and speech (53, 54). Focke et al. (54) also demonstrate altered structural connectivity between parahippocampal structures, providing a neuroanatomical basis for theoretical models of seizure propagation. In frontal lobe epilepsy, structural connectivity may remain intact in frontal regions, while nearby regions can be aﬀected by interictal and ictal activity (55). Epilepsy involving mesial frontal areas preserves a robust connectivity in the supplementary motor area. Similar lower ﬁber intensity found in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, but not in the cingulum, suggests particular functional abnormalities for children with focal epilepsies (56). Diﬀusion imaging may also be used in animal models to study the extent of\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n4\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\nCao et al.\n\nDynamical Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\n\nwhite matter impairment. A rat model of focal epilepsy has been studied using dMRI and shows widespread reductions in white matter density in extensive brain regions beyond the epileptic focus, indicating the impaired eﬃciency of functional networks (57). Animal models, however, are not the focus of this review.\nStructural networks deﬁned by structural connectivity are not a complete representation of a pathological brain. Due to limitations of current techniques, structural MRI can only capture a small proportion of network connections on the macroscopic level. Whether this limitation aﬀects interpretation of current studies in focal epilepsy remains unclear (45). Computer simulations show structural alterations are not necessary to generate seizure-like activity and epileptic networks are also believed to be fast-evolving dynamical networks (58). Therefore, rather than characterizing interconnected brain regions, static structural connectivity is more likely to answer how functional networks can be constrained by their corresponding structural substrates. This is important to keep in mind when interpreting ﬁndings on functional networks in focal epilepsy.\n3.2. Functional Networks in Focal Epilepsy\nPrevious studies using functional connectivity mainly focus on time-series analysis of interictal and ictal events and report on network structural alterations over time before, during and after a seizure. To gain insights into the fast-evolving functional networks of seizure activity, recording techniques with high sampling rates, such as EEG, iEEG, and MEG, are broadly employed for epilepsy research. A number of studies have demonstrated the capacity of functional network structures of fast-evolving seizures to reﬂect properties of the putative EZ (13, 18, 58–61).\nUsing sEEG recordings, Bartolomei et al. (14) are credited as the ﬁrst study to apply network analysis to explore non-linear relationships between diﬀerent brain regions in temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Bartolomei et al. (62) oﬀers a comprehensive review of network analysis speciﬁc to sEEG in epilepsy surgery. Khambhati et al. (19) show functional connectivity changes rapidly over time before focal seizure onset but not as much as it does during the seizure. By clustering time windows of iEEG data based on functional connectivity commonalities, Khambhati et al. (63) also ﬁnd higher levels of synchronization in brain states that are close to focal seizure termination as opposed to brain states at the beginning or the middle of the seizure. These ﬁndings indicate that the epileptic brain has diﬀerent functional network structures underlying seizure generation vs. termination. Schindler et al. (64) also demonstrated the shift in functional network structure toward a normal network state with transition from the pre-ictal to the ictal state.\nStudies have reported that the ictal network structure for generalized seizures was more regular than the corresponding interictal network structure, thus suggesting that seizure events with seemingly “random” functional connectivity may preserve common patterns (65–67). Distinct patterns of functional connectivity have also been reported around seizure onset. Kramer et al. (68) demonstrated the SOZ presents a dominant regular sub-network with densely connected nodes. As a seizure\n\nprogresses, the sub-network becomes divided into smaller random networks and hence the authors argue that these network features during the seizure progression may reﬂect decreased susceptibility of the network to become synchronized (68).\nInterictal brain networks have also been examined in functional network studies. Resting-state EEG and MEG recordings in focal epilepsy patients show an increase in functional connectivity, which could reﬂect increased cortical excitability predisposing to epileptic seizures (69, 70). These authors also identiﬁed a decrease in network eﬃciency compared to control networks, perhaps indicating brain network disruption associated with interictal activity. Others employing network analysis of interictal data report conﬂicting results. Bartolomei et al. (71) presented decreased clustering coeﬃcients and path lengths, while Horstmann et al. (72) show an increase in the same metrics. These inconsistencies could be due to diﬀerences in patient selection and methodologies. Current techniques representing functional networks may well need further reﬁnement to characterize a pathological brain, particularly a brain predisposed to seizures.\nFunctional networks have also been studied using fMRI in generalized and focal epilepsies. In temporal lobe epilepsy, a general decrease in functional connectivity has been reported in the ipsilateral hemisphere and subcortical structures (73, 74). Another study reports that besides a general decrease in global functional networks, there is a relative increase in functional connectivity within the aﬀected temporal lobe (75). In generalized epilepsy, a decreased intra-hemispheric connectivity and an increased inter-hemispheric connectivity are reported (76). Although associations between hemodynamic signals and electromagnetic signals require more investigation, these fMRI ﬁndings provide a diﬀerent perspective on network behavior based on interictal data.\n3.3. Relationship Between Structural and Functional Connectivity and Limitations of Connectivity Analysis\nTo date, a well-deﬁned relationship between functional and structural connectivity is still missing in the literature for several reasons. First, functional connectivity in meso-scale brain networks still lacks suﬃciently accurate neurophysiological and neuroanatomical substrates to interpret ﬁndings; to begin with, the coupling of structural to functional networks is not straightforward as ﬁndings from structural connectivity may not directly translate to neural dynamics governing interictal and ictal states. Second, structural connectivity is not always static and, as revealed by work in neuroplasticity, can change over longer time scales. Therefore, studies with diﬀerent followup protocols are not always comparable. Third, individual diﬀerences make ﬁndings diﬃcult to generalize statistically, especially when dealing with pathological substrates. For example, pathologies residing in diﬀerent cortical regions may result in diﬀerent functional and structural network structures complicating group analysis and potentially introducing errors to epileptic network modeling at the level of the individual. Such limitations of current connectivity analysis make it\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n5\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\nCao et al.\n\nDynamical Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\n\ndiﬃcult to clearly deﬁne the extent by which structural connectivity constrains functional connectivity. In the context of epilepsy, multiple factors potentially inﬂuence connectivity analysis ﬁndings. For example, the eﬀect of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) on functional and structural connectivity is unclear (59). Heterogeneity of epilepsy patients is also non-trivial. Diﬀerent lesion types and locations might exert diﬀerent eﬀects on functional and structural connectivity properties (77). Normally in epilepsy studies, patients with the same pathology and similar locations are grouped and studied together. Patients with the same pathology and similar locations may have very diﬀerent ictal or interictal electrographic activity, while patients with diﬀerent pathologies may demonstrate similar electrographic features (59). These factors need to be considered when validating network models in cohorts obeying conventional patient selection.\nContradictory results from diﬀerent imaging modalities also inﬂuence how ﬁndings should be interpreted. EEG and MEG studies usually show global increases in functional connectivity compared to healthy controls, while fMRI studies show a general decrease. This might reﬂect fundamental diﬀerences between hemodynamic coupling and electrophysiological dynamics in epilepsy, not least in their respective temporal and spatial resolutions (78). Future studies that assess the relationship between neurophysiologic and hemodynamic connectivity are needed, possibly through simultaneous multi-modal neuroimaging studies (16, 59, 79, 80).\n4. NETWORK ANALYSIS OF FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORKS\nNetworks are an abstract mathematical construction that aim to represent the interaction of complex real-world systems. This concept has been introduced to many disciplines including physics, biology, ecology and neuroscience, to describe the mathematical behavior of complex systems. In neuroscience, networks are generally derived from functional and structural connectivity pathways, where “nodes” stand for diﬀerent brain regions and “links” represent anatomical paths between brain regions or statistical correlations between neural activity (81). Network analysis using graph theoretical metrics, for example, has oﬀered insights into how diﬀerent brain regions are structurally connected and how diﬀerent brain regions interact with each other spatio-temporally (49).\nOver the last 5 years, network analysis has become a hot topic in clinical neuroscience research, as a pathological brain shows distinct features in structural and functional networks against a healthy brain (66, 67, 82). These brain network features can be used as biomarkers for clinical application. As epilepsy is becoming more recognized as a brain network disorder, network analysis allows us to study epilepsy and epileptic seizures from a novel perspective (18, 83, 84). The next section discusses how to deﬁne networks using connectivity methods and extract network features using graph-theoretical metrics. It also discusses ﬁndings and their interpretation from network analysis, and potential biomarkers that can be used for clinical applications.\n\n4.1. Nodes and Edges\nA network is composed of nodes and edges that link nodes. In functional brain networks, nodes stand for diﬀerent brain areas and edges stand for functional dependence between regional activities (85). The way nodes and edges are deﬁned often depends on the imaging modality that is used. For example, with fMRI, we can use a voxel, or several neighboring voxels as a node (86); independent component analysis (ICA) can also be used to aggregate voxels into nodes (87). Time-series of nodes that have the same independent component can be aggregated into a node. For sensor-based modalities, such as EEG and MEG, the preference is to directly use sensors as nodes or assign nodes in reconstructed source space (88). Brain parcelations of structural MRI also provides a sophisticated means of assigning brain areas to nodes, although this requires a-priori knowledge of individual brain structures and a standard brain atlas (89).\nEdges are typically estimated by quantifying statistical dependency of neural activity between two regions (90). However, edges are not necessarily equal to connectivity matrices, as network edges can be binary (edge is either zero and not connected, or one and connected) or weighted (when normally a graph ﬁlter is applied to extract important edges). The reason to apply a graph ﬁlter is that functional connectivity can be aﬀected by noise and other measures and graph ﬁltering can remove such connections (91).\nThere are multiple ways to apply graph ﬁlters to brain networks. Setting a threshold to connectivity matrices can extract dominant connections. However, one of the problems with setting a hard threshold to a matrix is that edge weights can signiﬁcantly increase or decrease depending on the brain state. Therefore, a constant hard threshold for diﬀerent time windows may bias global network structures. Proportional thresholding can help with time window problems as it iteratively extracts topranked connections. However, a common problem of network thresholding is that without deﬁning connections of interest, dominant connections across a certain time window could be irrelevant to analysis or might have even been generated by artifacts (92). In an eﬀort to address such issues, Langer et al. (92) proposed the use of sophisticated statistics in their study, but given the enormous complexity of neural activity, it is diﬃcult to select neural activities that are relevant for study by examining whether or not they are statistically correlated.\n4.2. Graph Theoretical Metrics\nWith established functional networks, graph-theoretical metrics can be applied to study network properties. A number of graphtheoretical metrics have been developed to measure diﬀerent network topological features and each of them has speciﬁc assumptions and requirements of the network (81). In general, graph-theoretical metrics extract four categories of network features: integration, segregation, motif, and centrality (93). For example, clustering coeﬃcients and community detection metrics quantify how densely subgroups are connected in a network. Shortest path metrics, such as global eﬃciency and characteristic path length, estimate levels of network integration. Betweenness centrality and closeness centrality detect important hubs that bridge multiple sub-groups. Diﬀerent metrics, by their\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n6\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\nCao et al.\n\nDynamical Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\n\nTABLE 1 | Commonly used graph-theoretical metrics and their scales, features, and requirements (81, 93).\n\nScale\nWhole brain network\nSubnetworks\nNodes\n\nMetric\nCharacteristic path length Global efﬁciency Clustering coefﬁcient Local efﬁciency Modularity Motifs Transitivity Edge betweenness Degree Number of triangles around a node\nShortest path length\nCloseness centrality Betweenness centrality\n\nCategory Integration\nIntegration\nSegregation\nSegregation Segregation Motif Segregation Segregation\nBasic metric Basic metric for segregation Basic metric for segregation Centrality\nCentrality\n\nFeatures\n\nWeighted\n\nDirected\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNegative No No No No Yes No No No No No\nNo\nNo No\n\nRequirements/ Connected Yes\nNo\nNo No No No No No N/A N/A\nN/A\nNo\nNo\n\ndeﬁnition, extract diﬀerent network properties, as shown in Table 1.\nSelecting appropriate graph-theoretical metrics in studies is non-trivial. This metric selection normally depends on the research question, assumptions, and hypothesis (78). Several questions may be asked when choosing metrics, such as does the study focus on whole brain networks or sub-region networks? Is the study assuming its networks are fully connected or operating as isolated nodes or sub-groups? Does the study look at important nodes in networks? Speciﬁc hypotheses may lead studies to mainly look at a subset of nodes and edges, which may require tailored metrics to extract features of interest. Metric selection should also consider what imaging modality functional networks are derived from. Just as diﬀerent imaging modalities have diﬀerent spatio-temporal resolutions and reﬂect neural dynamics at diﬀerent spatio-temporal scales, functional networks have diﬀerent features and properties (94). Graph-theoretical metrics applied to these networks should take the inherent assumptions of speciﬁc network properties into account.\nThorough statistical tests of network models are critical. There are two ways of testing network models: (1) compare against numerically simulated reference models and (2) compare with models derived from other conditions, such as task vs. restingstate or healthy vs. pathologic (93). A statistically “null model” is often used as a reference model to test whether the phenomena that a model observes is random (95). However, a null model is not always statistically random. A null model is often assigned\n\nproperties that the derived model shares. For example, a null model normally has the same node degree distribution and similar modular structure. Although network link weights of a null model usually remain random, they still follow distributions of the derived model (96).\n4.3. Interpretation and Biomarkers\nA question that is often raised when results are obtained from network analysis is how to interpret ﬁndings. Unfortunately, this question is not easy to answer. As discussed in previous sections, connectivity methods and graph-theoretical metrics reduce the dimensions of neuroimaging data but also increase levels of abstraction (97). Although new information can be obtained with higher levels of abstraction, we also lose the ability to directly interpret results and to understand neurophysiological substrates (98). Speciﬁcally, a small change in original neural signals will propagate through levels of abstraction, along with added complexity. In other words, any change at a high level of abstraction may not have a one-to-one mapping to original signals. Current studies use variable-control strategies to rule out factors that do not aﬀect ﬁnal results (99). However, this strategy may not be available when using complex approaches, such as network analysis. Interpreting results has remained a challenge in this area and current studies are generally conservative and cautious with interpretation.\nAlthough interpreting ﬁndings from complex network analysis remains challenging, these ﬁndings can still be used\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n7\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\nCao et al.\n\nDynamical Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\n\nas potential biomarkers for clinical applications. For example, functional and structural coupling and decoupling have been found to be complex and mechanisms remain unknown (100). However, distinct patterns of decoupled functional and structural network structures may reﬂect long-term impairment in idiopathic generalized epilepsy patients and may be used as a biomarker to detect subtle brain abnormalities (100). Zweiphenning et al. (101) found high-frequency functional networks have distinct biomarkers that statistically predict the location of the seizure onset zone using interictal iEEG data. These biomarkers are useful for patients who do not have frequent clinical or sub-clinical seizures on iEEG monitoring. Studies using network modeling and network analysis have also discovered biomarkers with the potential to predict outcomes of epilepsy surgery (19, 29, 32, 102). These biomarkers may prove to be useful for presurgical evaluation if ﬁndings can be validated clinically through prospective studies and clinical trials.\n4.4. Volume Conduction and Source Connectivity\nThe biophysical nature of volume conduction from neural sources to recorded signals can introduce ﬁeld spread or smearing in connectivity calculations, whereby instantaneously correlated signals are reconstructed in localized brain areas and spurious connections are identiﬁed by conventional connectivity analysis. The early work in the biophysics of brain volume conductor modeling for electrophysiological signals has discussed this issue and is summarized in the review by Vorwerk et al. (103).\nUnfortunately, this issue is not alleviated when simpler forward solutions are applied to MEG source reconstruction. Volume conduction also raises the concern as to whether or not non-invasive source analysis can achieve the spatial accuracy of invasive intracranial approaches. This is because volume conduction smears the electrical potential ﬁeld (as well as the magnetic ﬁeld) generated by a current dipole in the brain, particularly when the smeared ﬁeld is observed from far aﬁeld. Fortunately, volume conduction only “mixes” neural activity in a linear fashion with zero delay in phase synchrony. This opens the door to ﬁnd ways to limit volume-conduction related spurious connections interfering with connectivity calculations. By understanding the principle of volume conduction, various techniques have been developed over the last two decades to remove instantaneous correlation and phase synchrony between a pair of signals (65, 104–108). Unfortunately, a recent study that assesses these techniques demonstrates that none guarantee full identiﬁcation and removal of spurious connections (109). Some approaches perform better than others in certain simulated paradigms but these may also turn out to be too conservative to remove real connections (110). While volume conduction can complicate the use of brain network approaches for the study of neural mechanisms, some argue that volume conduction is not a major concern when a biomarker of a certain phenomenon is the goal.\n\n4.5. Studies Using Network Analysis for Epilepsy Surgery\nEarly work by Kramer at al. (111) looked at pre-seizure, seizure and post-seizure functional networks in four patients and uncovered localized brain structures that appear to facilitate seizure generation. This ﬁnding suggested that network analysis can assist identiﬁcation of pathological brain areas and potentially target these areas for surgical treatment (111). Later, Wilke et al. (112) used directional networks and graph theoretical metrics to investigate interictal and ictal iEEG networks. More recently, a new technique, virtual cortical resection, has been developed using functional networks and validated against clinical iEEG data (19, 63, 94, 113). By analysing functional connectivity patterns of ictal iEEG data, Khambati et al. (63) developed a framework that statistically describes network dynamics in seizure generation, propagation, and termination. The topographic and geometrical changes captured by their model suggest strengthened synchronous connectivity near foci may help seizure termination. This ﬁnding suggests that modulating certain circuits near pathologic foci may disrupt seizure propagation or control seizure generation. Khambhati et al. (19) later extended the network model by analysing focal seizures with and without secondary generalization. The authors hypothesized that focal seizures with secondary generalization are more likely to synchronize in the pre-seizure state and there is a regulatory network mechanism that controls whether a focal seizure generalizes secondarily. A measure, synchronizability, which has been used in stability analysis of complex systems (114), was used to quantify stability and heterogeneity of timevarying functional networks in the model. And a novel metric, control centrality, was proposed to quantitatively estimate how the synchronizability of a network changes when a node is virtually removed from the network (virtual cortical resection). Counter-intuitively, brain regions that regulate seizure dynamics and control secondary generalization were often found to sit outside the SOZ. The implication here is that surgical resection of the SOZ alone does not necessarily lead to long-term seizure freedom. Their novel approach also provides a framework to develop techniques that can computationally simulate epilepsy surgery in order to provide an optimal surgical strategy. Kini et al. (113) further extend the framework using ictal events from iEEG and provide a statistical bio-marker that supports the idea that synchronizing nodes in the network should be removed in surgery, pending overlap with eloquent cortex.\nA study by Jiang et al. (115) independently revealed similar “push-pull” dynamics that regulate secondary generalization of focal seizures. Diﬀering from the speciﬁc gamma band of Khambhati et al. (19), Jiang et al.’s (115) push-pull dynamics comes from within- and across- frequency oscillations. Sohrabpour et al. (20) applied network analysis to the EEG source space to provide a non-invasively derived prediction of the EZ.\nOther studies (112, 116) use directional networks to identify a subset of brain areas for potential surgical removal. Hassan et al. (117) and Juarez-Martinez et al. (118) extend network approaches to EEG and MEG source space with relatively small numbers of patients compared to Sohrabpour et al. (20).

Other network analysis studies using pre- and post-operative EEG, MEG, and fMRI data also found signiﬁcant changes in functional connectivity patterns that were predictive of surgical outcomes (13, 18, 119, 120). A summary of studies using network analysis is given in Table 2 and a comparison of network analysis and network modeling approaches by modality and source-sensor space is given in Table 3.\nDespite the growing number of studies using network analysis for epilepsy surgical localization, prospective clinical studies are lacking. The numbers of patients included in studies has increased from one patient (117) to 36 patients (20). The retrospective nature and modest number of patients combine to limit the applicability and generalizability of network analysis approaches to clinical work-up for epilepsy surgery.\n5. NETWORK MODELS FOR EPILEPSY SURGERY\nDynamical network modeling is a branch of network science employing mathematical and computational techniques to depict, analyse and understand the dynamical behavior of the network i.e., how a speciﬁc network structure impacts on the system behavior, particularly state transitions and bifurcations, through a set of evolution equations that yields quantitatively accurate depiction and prediction (123). Such techniques enable the properties of patient-speciﬁc functional network structures to be interrogated and the ensuing dynamics to be explained and predicted. In the case of diseased brain networks such as epilepsy, the evaluation and prediction of pathological state transitions such as seizures is invaluable in a clinical context such as epilepsy surgery. As opposed to network analysis, network models use established network structures as a basis and embed dynamical mathematical models to network nodes coupled by edge weights to simulate overall network dynamics. The process uses static functional networks derived from time-series data to a dynamical mathematical system that changes over time such that various states of brain networks can be numerically simulated for analysis. Here we present established network models for epilepsy surgery and include studies that have applied these models to empirical data.\n5.1. Network Models\nFour main network modeling techniques have been applied to epilepsy surgery: “Virtual Epileptic Patient” using the “Epileptor” model from Jirsa et al. (36), “Virtual Cortical Resection” model using network synchronizability and control centrality from Khambhati et al. (19), a computational model using network excitability from Goodfellow et al. (29) and another computational model similarly using network excitability from Sinha et al. (31).\nThe Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) model is a hybrid model using a phenomenologically derived neural ﬁeld model, the Epileptor model (124). Each network node is deﬁned in\n\ncombination with structural networks and hypotheses derived from MRI lesions and other clinical information. This model uses the theory of fast-slow non-linear dynamics to characterize the bifurcations for seizure onset and oﬀset. The VEP model demonstrates the prediction of ictal spatial patterns and conﬁrmation of presurgical hypotheses (30, 124, 125), which may beneﬁt presurgical evaluation and planning of invasive intracranial monitoring. It models epileptiform discharges in computational simulations and identiﬁes the similar bifurcation mechanisms that produce epileptiform discharges using real data. The Epileptor model has demonstrated a capacity to predict seizure propagation using ictal sEEG data (124, 125).\nLater work (21, 30, 36, 126) proposed an individualized wholebrain model that incorporates functional and structural network models. The Epileptor signiﬁes an advance in mathematical modeling of epileptic seizures not only because the model provides a form of taxonomy of seizure activity using nonlinear coupled oscillators, but it also provides a mathematical etiology of seizure dynamics. Another advantage of this Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) is that, by combining the modeling of neural dynamics with the modeling of structural networks, the approach provides explanatory and predictive capacity in a clinical setting. Using sEEG combined with structural imaging modalities, this integrated approach virtually reproduces the seizure spread over the network that predicts the EZ (36). It is worth noting though that the VEP model requires sophisticated iEEG and neuroimaging workup and demands much of computing resources.\nAlthough neuroimaging modalities, including DTI and fMRI, have been routinely used by some centers in presurgical epilepsy workup, scanner availability and scanning time are still limited in many surgical centers, especially those in developing countries. Despite the limitations of the VEP model, the ﬁndings encourage the use of the VEP model in a multi-center clinical trial. Such an integrated approach has the potential to be extended to the study of normal brain networks and to other neurological diseases.\nThe virtual cortical resection model provides speciﬁc insights into seizure evolution, particularly seizure initiation, and termination (19). Unlike the Virtual Epileptic Patient (36), the virtual cortical resection model only uses data from invasive intracranial recordings. By converting intracranial signals into fast evolving functional networks over time, two network metrics from network control theory (synchronizability and control centrality) are used to explore the contribution a node makes to the network dynamics. The virtual resection technique employed Master Stability Function (MSF) to estimate stability of synchronization (i.e., synchronizability) by looking at eigenspectra over time. However, MSF treats each node in the network as identical and synchronized and hence, is less concerned with individual dynamics (127). By correlating the mathematical change in functional network structure to clinical resection margins and surgical outcomes, the model suggests network nodes with high control centrality are likely to be included in the resection when a patient achieves a favorable outcome. The synchronizability values of functional networks using data before seizure onset successfully predict whether a focal seizure secondarily generalizes.

It oﬀers an objective approach for surgery and carries the potential to optimize the surgical strategy.\nThe computational model from Goodfellow et al. (29) uses the Wendling Model (33, 128) to describe nodal level neural dynamics from functional connectivity analysis of ictal iEEG signals. While each node has the same dynamics characteristics, the network topology determines how the network transitions from the non-seizure state to the seizure state. The model is calibrated to assume that 50% of the nodes in the network transition into a seizure state with the whole network spending 50% of its time in a seizure state (29, 35). The total amount of time the network spends in the seizure state may increase, decrease, or remain the same when the network topology is changed with the removal of a given node. The assumption of this model is that virtually removed nodes that shorten seizure state time should be removed to reduce the risk of ictogenesis. A series of studies based on the theta model (35), which is a simpliﬁed version of the Wendling model, showed a correlation between model prediction and surgical outcome. By doing so, the model oﬀers an opportunity to optimize surgical strategy for cases with unfavorable surgical outcomes. Another computational model from Sinha et al. (31) uses a similar mathematical framework (23, 129) to predict surgical outcomes and alternative surgical strategies.\n5.2. Studies Using Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\nThe work from Goodfellow et al. (29) and Jirsa et al. (36) are the early attempts to apply network models to intracranial data obtained for epilepsy surgery. These fundamental contributions motivated by earlier theoretical work (23, 124, 129–131) led to a series of publications aiming to more objectively and accurately predict the EZ. Goodfellow et al. (29) employed a full Wendling model to simulate excitability at the nodal level and predict\n\nsurgical outcomes based on degree of overlap between modelpredicted ictogenic nodes and resection margins. The study suggested that at least one node of high ictogenicity should be included in the surgical resection to achieve a more favorable surgical outcome. To better understand the relationship between SOZ and EZ, another measure, Seizure Likelihood was developed together with an earlier measure, Node Ictogenicity (NI) (29) to systematically compare the SOZ with the EZ. It was found that the SOZ may not be the best predictor of the EZ when there is signiﬁcant heterogeneity in network topology and node excitability (132). This is perhaps in line with the clinical observation that SOZ-based resections do not always provide optimal outcomes (5). A later study on the same dataset reveals that a so-called “rich-club” organization (133) (a structure with multiple hub nodes that densely interconnect sub-networks) can be found in epilepsy surgical candidates and that disruption of rich-club modules might optimize surgical outcomes (35). This ﬁnding is also predicted by simulations using the same theoretical model that is simpler than the Wendling model. The most recent work by Lopes et al. (122) has extended their network model to non-invasive EEG source space. Using a simpliﬁed Wendling model and minimum-norm estimation, EEG source signals are modeled in a similar fashion to iEEG signals. Their results suggest that the network model predicts the lateralization of epileptogenic sources with modest spatial resolution. This work represents an important step in the eﬀort to more objectively characterize the EZ non-invasively using source space signals and network models.\nBy extending the work of Jansen et al. (134) to also include a slow inhibitory population, Wendling et al. (129) model seizure onset by mathematically simulating the fast and slow oscillations of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. This model was used by Terry et al. (23) to inversely ﬁt intracranial EEG data. Bettus et al. (69) and Wendling et al. (135) also applied the model to both intracranial EEG and scalp EEG. Wendling et al. (136) then extend the network model to understand seizure\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n11\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\nCao et al.\n\nDynamical Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\n\ngeneration and propagation networks. More recent work has looked at the eﬀects of disrupting network nodes that regulate seizure propagation (19, 113, 137) with results that challenge the traditional approach of SOZ resection as best practice for epilepsy surgery (19, 29, 94, 113, 132).\nA multi-level computational model has lately been proposed to better replicate observed signals from experimental data for improved prediction of ictogenesis. This network model has been extended to EEG source space with promising results that reﬂect a good match between the interictal EEG source network and the interictal sEEG network (138). The study also found that the multi-level network model performs better in the localization of multi-focal epilepsy.\n5.3. Summary of Network Models for Epilepsy Surgery\nIt is diﬃcult to compare diﬀerent studies using network models to predict the EZ owing to diﬀerences in the initial modeling assumptions and variation in patient cohorts, iEEG approaches, pathologies, and post-operative follow-up. The dominance of small studies and single case reports also limits the translatability of these approaches to the clinical setting. As presented in Table 4, there is accumulating evidence that network models can (a) predict the EZ using invasive neurophysiological data and non-invasive EEG data, (b) help unravel mechanisms of ictal and interictal discharge generation and propagation, and (c) allow the study of brain networks to be conducted in a patientspeciﬁc fashion. Long-term prospective studies are now needed, particularly with network modeling approaches based on the use of non-invasive, whole-brain data in an eﬀort to reduce our reliance on invasively acquired data.\n6. DISCUSSION\nDynamical network models have the potential to improve characterization and delineation of the EZ. While initially based on iEEG recordings, these models have more recently been extended to the analysis of non-invasive EEG and MEG wholebrain recordings that, unlike iEEG, are not aﬀected by limited spatial sampling, nor sensor positions.\n6.1. Advantages of This Approach\nDynamical network modeling approaches represent an important shift away from a subjective interpretation of iEEG recordings toward an objective quantiﬁcation of the putative EZ with their novel analyses of EEG and MEG interictal and ictal electrophysiological signals. By testing the eﬀects of candidate epileptogenic nodes on network excitability and seizure transition states, these approaches permit deliberate, step-wise hypothesis testing of neural pathways that are critical for seizure generation and propagation before any surgical intervention takes place (29, 31, 32, 35). And, while not the focus of this review, in patients who are not deemed surgical candidates, these approaches may still be useful for neuromodulation targets. Recent work from Li et al. (40) and Scheid et al. (39) suggests “weak” nodes can be identiﬁed using network models for which neuromodulation strategies may\n\nbe devised to reduce seizure susceptibility. Further study is required to clinically validate this concept. The interrogation of whole-brain structural and functional networks overcomes the major limitation of traditional invasive monitoring that is highly dependent on the implicit assumption that iEEG electrodes are placed in the ideal position for accurate delineation of the EZ (20). The approach also minimizes the inﬂuence of subjective clinical interpretation of seizure semiology in the pre-surgical work-up of these patients. For pre-operative planning, the quantiﬁable nature of dynamical network modeling facilitates an objective comparison with traditional non-invasive methods of EZ mapping, such as PET (positron emission tomography) and SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography).\n6.2. Limitations of This Approach\nThere are several limitations of dynamical network modeling combined with EEG and MEG source imaging. As discussed previously, ﬁeld spread and signal leakage reduces the spatial resolution of source solutions and may limit the capacity of models to accurately identify the EZ (109, 140). Modeling is also dependent on the acquisition of high quality EEG or MEG interictal and ictal signals with minimal noise and artifact interference (141, 142). As also noted, all network models have underlying mathematical and physiological assumptions that may not be entirely valid such that, to date, no favored systematic approach exists (33). The veracity of these assumptions can only be rigorously tested with prospective epilepsy surgery studies, which are currently lacking. Indeed, dynamic network modeling is still in its infancy and the relationship between structural networks and functional networks is not yet clear, particularly with respect to a complex problem such as epilepsy. To date, these approaches cannot reliably distinguish between diﬀerent anatomical structures based on the speciﬁc pathology.\n6.3. Next Steps\nMulti-modal neuroimaging techniques have assisted pre-surgical characterization of the putative EZ in pharmaco-refractory focal epilepsy. Better techniques are needed for the more challenging patients with MRI-normal and complex lesional focal epilepsy (141, 143, 144). To this end, network analysis and dynamical network models have shown considerable promise with their more objective computational approach to ﬁnding a surgical solution in these diﬃcult cases (29–31). As pointed out here and by others (13, 18, 50, 113, 145), large cohorts are required to assess the eﬀectiveness of these approaches in the clinical setting. Dynamical modeling may further assist by combining with diﬀerent neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and tractography, to better model patient-speciﬁc brain structures and pathological dynamics to improve the eﬃcacy and clinical utility of epilepsy surgery. How such a combined approach provides clinical value is yet to be fully elucidated but recent achievements by Jirsa et al. (124) and Proix et al. (30) demonstrate the merit of incorporating functional and structural information into the predictive model. It is conceivable that whole brain dynamic network modeling approaches may eventually render intracranial exploration unnecessary or even\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n12\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\nMarch 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 837893\n\n13\n\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nTABLE 4 | A summary of studies using network models for epilepsy surgery.\n\nReferences\n\nNetwork model\n\nPatient number\n\nClinical data\n\nGoodfellow et al.

The limitations of intracranial monitoring in its current forms disqualiﬁes it as a true gold standard for mapping EZ networks. The evolution of more sophisticated wholebrain dynamic modeling approaches, which can overcome the sampling problem, might establish a new standard for presurgical epilepsy planning that is closer to the ground truth for unraveling EZ pathways. Potential beneﬁts for epilepsy surgery patients might include reduced peri-operative morbidity and improved post-operative outcome. Routine clinical application might help elucidate the structural and functional substrates that link seizure semiology to seizure onset and propagation (146) with less clinical subjectivity to the point where elements of the semiology, not routinely included in existing models, could reﬁne future network modeling strategies.\n\n“precision” medicine. The increasing sophistication of structural and functional connectivity analysis (from MRI, fMRI, DTI, EEG, and MEG) has paved the way for the evolution of many promising dynamical network modeling strategies. Most importantly, in the clinical context of epilepsy surgery, the aim is to improve patient evaluation and perform a successful resection that grants patients long-term seizure freedom for a better quality of life. The potential clinical impact of dynamical network modeling to improve post-surgical outcomes and to limit the subjectivity and invasiveness tied to current-day intracranial monitoring will only be realized with successful translation of these approaches to large prospective clinical studies.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n7.
