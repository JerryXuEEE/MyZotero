Better efficacy has been associated with stimulation sites that are 1) more anterior and lateral and 2) more functionally connected to the subgenual cingulate. Here we prospectively test whether these factors predict response in individual patients. \nMethods \n \nA primary cohort (Boston, n  = 25) with medication-refractory depression underwent conventional open-label rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . A secondary cohort (Michigan, n  = 16) underwent 4 weeks of sham followed by open-label rTMS for nonresponders ( n  = 12). In each patient, the location of the stimulation site was recorded with frameless stereotaxy . Connectivity between each patient’s stimulation site and the subgenual cingulate was assessed using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging from a cohort of healthy subjects ( n  = 1000) and confirmed using connectivity from patients with depression ( n  = 38). \nResults \n \nIn our primary cohort, antidepressant efficacy was predicted by stimulation sites that were both more anterolateral ( r  = .51, p < .01) and more negatively correlated with the subgenual cingulate ( r  = −.55, p < .005). However, subgenual connectivity was the only independent predictor of response and the only factor to predict response to active ( r  = −.52, p < .05) but not sham rTMS in our secondary cohort. \nConclusions \n \nThis study provides prospective validation that functional connectivity between an individual’s rTMS cortical target and the subgenual cingulate predicts antidepressant response. Implications for improving the cortical rTMS target for depression are discussed. \nSection snippets \nMethods and Materials \n \nFull methodological details can be found in the Supplement. Briefly, data from two cohorts of patients with medication-resistant major depressive disorder treated with 4 to 7 weeks of daily rTMS applied over the left DLPFC were included. The primary cohort was prospectively enrolled and received conventional open-label rTMS at the Berenson-Allen Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. Outcome was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI). The \nPatient and Treatment Characteristics \n \nOur primary cohort included 25 right-handed patients with medication-resistant major depressive disorder (17 females) with a mean age of 54.8 years (SD = 9.9, range = 28–67 years of age; see Supplemental Figure S1 for details of patient flow). The mean BDI score at baseline was 38.6 (SD = 9.3) and significantly decreased to 21.2 (SD = 13.0) after the course of rTMS treatment ( t 24  = 10.05, p < .0001). Thirteen of 25 patients were identified as responders (defined as ≥50% reduction in BDI score). \nDiscussion \n \nThere are three important findings in the present study. First, stronger anticorrelation between a patient’s cortical rTMS site and the subgenual cingulate predicts clinical outcome in individual patients. Second, subgenual connectivity is an independent predictor of clinical response and specific to active compared to sham stimulation. Third, subgenual connectivity predicts improvement in cognitive and affective but not somatic symptoms of depression. These findings each have implications for \nAcknowledgments and Disclosures \n \nThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant Nos.
