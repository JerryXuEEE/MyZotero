As neuroimaging techniques advance with time, the relationship between structure and function has become the object of many studies in neuroscience. As recently suggested, the well-deﬁned connectivity structure found in the brain can be used to understand the self organization of the brain at rest, as well as to infer the functional connectivity patterns of the brain using diﬀerent models. These models include the Kuramoto model, which studies synchronization, and the two-dimensional classical Ising model, which studies the global dynamics of the brain at the critical temperature. These models have been successful in capturing the underlying properties of the brain. To extend this understanding, our objective is to develop the generalized Ising model, following the lesson from the two-dimensional Ising model, as the generalized Ising model could be simulated using the anatomical structure of the brain. This model can then be used to study functional information integration and segregation in the brain at rest. Thus, the primary research question would be: can the generalized Ising model explain the functional behaviour of the resting brain at the critical temperature? Preliminary analyses were carried out to determine the critical temperature of the models and to compare the correlation distributions. Further analyses were carried out using graph theory considering the brain as a network. By observing the results obtained from our simulations, it can be inferred that there is a temperature that is diﬀerent from the critical temperature of the model at which the generalized Ising model shows a match with the empirical functional connectivity. At that temperature, the generalized Ising model could be used to study the global dynamics, as well as the local dynamics of the brain.\nKeywords: Ising model, Structure and function of the brain, Graph Theory\nii\n\nDedication\nTo my family, for their unconditional love and care...\nTo my adorable nephew, for his priceless love and the biggest heart...\niii\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe preparation and compilation of this Dissertation would not have been possible if not for the assistance and support given to me by my seniors, family and friends.\nI would like to take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Andrea Soddu for the assistance he rendered to me and for the amount of tolerance he demonstrated when directing me in the correct path to make this dissertation a success.

It is one of the organs that scientists are still struggling to understand. The understanding available so far about the brain is mostly due to developments in brain imaging techniques. However, we are trying to build a bridge between mathematical modelling and the biological aspects of the human brain to open up new opportunities to widen our understanding of its behaviour.\nThat being said, the introduction of mathematics to biology and medicine has drawn much interest recently. Mathematical models are built in general to describe some aspects of nature in a numerical manner such that they could be used to predict unseen behaviours in nature. The spatial scale of modelling varies depending on the scale of the expected end result. In this research, as we are discussing the behaviour of the brain (which has a complex structure), it is not realistic to talk in terms of the nano-scale or micro-scale using the available resources. Thus rather than applying mathematical modelling for our studies at the ﬁnest scale, the models are being developed at macroscopic level.\n1\n\n2\n\nChapter 1. Introduction\n\nHowever, our brain is comprised of neurons, which form diﬀerent types of structural networks. This structural or the anatomical connectivity allows electrical signals to pass through and exchange information among diﬀerent regions of the brain. On the other hand, the neurons create functional networks depending on their functionality, such as cognition and perception. Even though there are discussions about a possible connection between these two types of connectivity patterns (structural and functional), the exact connection is still debatable. Nevertheless, the purpose of this research is to develop a tool that enables us to ﬁnd the relationship between the structure and the function of the brain using computational modelling. In terms of modelling, we use the structural connectivity obtained from brain imaging as an input for the simulations, and we will be comparing the output of the model with the empirical data of the functional activity in the brain to ﬁnd the structure-function relationship.\n\n1.2 Motivation & Objectives\nAs per the common understanding, inside the brain, there are billions of neurons that collectively are the foundation of who we are. This fact makes the brain more diﬃcult to understand and still there is no experimental method, or an imaging technique, that can explain the complete behaviour of the brain at a single neuronal level. However, our objective was to ﬁnd a mathematical model, that can be used to simplify our understanding at the macroscopic scale and can be advanced to better spatial resolution in the future. For this purpose, we introduce the generalized Ising model as a good candidate for our study.\nThe generalization was performed starting with the two-dimensional classical Ising model which explains the interactions of magnetic spins. The spins are arranged in a two-dimensional lattice which is in contact with a heat bath. The model has only one model parameter, the tem-\n\n1.3. Thesis Outline\n\n3\n\nperature of the heat bath. Arrangements of spins change as a function of temperature and as a result of that, the properties of this system change. During the studies of this model, a temperature called the critical temperature was identiﬁed as the temperature which diﬀerentiate the conﬁgurations of spins into two categories, order and disorder. In previous work related to neuroscience and modelling, the two-dimensional classical Ising model has been studied at diﬀerent temperatures and has been compared with the dynamics of the brain function, which resulted in providing a good match between the model and the empirical data at the critical temperature. Thus we use the two-dimensional classical Ising model and generalize it by introducing the structural connectivity of the brain for the simulations of the model.\n\nTherefore, brieﬂy, the problem we are investigating in this research is: can the generalized Ising model be used to explain the structure-function relationship of the brain at the critical temperature? If so, can this model be used to predict the functional changes in the brain in the presence of a brain disorder by using the observed structural changes? Initially we are carrying out this research on healthy subjects, and later on, we can expand our limits towards patients with brain disorders due to severe brain injuries in order to answer the second question.\n\n1.3 Thesis Outline\nThis thesis contains ﬁve chapters organized as follows. The ﬁrst chapter gives a general introduction. The second chapter will provide the necessary understanding of the background of the research. It will describe the basics of neuronal communication as well as the neuroimaging techniques. Furthermore, detailed descriptions of computational models that have been used will be given. The third chapter will explain the experimental methodology, including the computer simulations of the models. The results of the simulations are shown in the next chapter. Finally, the last chapter will contain the conclusions of the work followed by a discussion. This will include possible directions for future research.\n\nChapter 2\nBackground & related work\n2.1 Overview\nThis chapter intends to provide the background of the research. At the beginning, we will explain the neuronal communication in the brain with a brief explanation of the nature of functional and structural connectivity. Then we will talk about two diﬀerent brain imaging techniques, one of which is being used to study the behaviour of the brain, the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and the other of which is being used to study the structure of the brain, Diﬀusion Weighted Imaging (DWI). This discussion will be followed by an introduction to two computer-simulated models that have been used in the past in order to model the dynamics of the brain. The reason for choosing the Ising model out of the two models will be presented as well. After that, the generalized Ising model will be introduced as the model we propose to model the dynamics of the brain as well as to ﬁnd the structure-function relationship in the brain. This will be followed by an introduction to the graph theory that we apply in order to compare the classical Ising model and the generalized Ising model in this context. This description will include an introduction to some important graph theoretical properties.\n4\n\n2.2. Neuronal Communication\n\n5\n\n2.2 Neuronal Communication\n\nThe human brain is made up of billions of neurons, which are the foundation of all the thoughts, feelings and memories that constitute our sense of identity. The most important thing to maintaining a high eﬃciency while performing any task is ’communication’, and it is maintained in our brains via neurons. They are used to communicate among diﬀerent regions of the brain that are functionally specialized for diﬀerent tasks. Thus, by integrating the work of separate regions, it is possible to coordinate diﬀerent functions of diﬀerent organs in the body.\n\nNeurons are sensors that can pass information through electrochemical signals. They can generate electrical impulses in response to diﬀerent types of signals they receive, and transmit those signals to other cells. In order to do this, a neuron is comprised of two basic parts: the cell body and the axon (Figure 2.1). The cell body contains several dendrites distributed much like the branches of a tree. This branching architecture of the dendrites allows the cell body to receive signals from a number of cells. The signals entering the neurons are received via the dendrites, and an action potential is generated according to the received signals. The action potential is generated due to the charged atoms (ions) in the cells.\n\n6\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\nFigure 2.1: Main components of a neuron [1]\nA cell is made out of chambers that contain various types of ions. Depending on the incoming signals, these chambers release diﬀerent amounts of ions in diﬀerent types. Due to this, a voltage diﬀerence is created which gives rise to a small current. Therefore, when the neuronal impulse begins, the potential of the cell changes dramatically. This change is called the action potential. The action potentials are transmitted to the axon terminals through relatively long axons. At the end of the neuron (i.e. axon terminal), a chemical messenger called a neurotransmitter is then released to the synapses, which is the junction between two nerve cells (Figure 2.1). This neurotransmitter binds with the receptors at the dendrites of the next cell. The receptors act as the source of the action potential of that cell. This process is repeated billions of times, and the electrical impulses are transmitted throughout.\nHowever, it is a well-known fact that the neurons do not function as individual units. Instead, hundreds of neurons, which are synchronized together, collectively form a patch of cortex. Apparently, inside the brain there exist large groups of such patches of cortices, which can either be synchronized or desynchronized abruptly, creating various sizes of temporary\n\n2.2. Neuronal Communication\n\n7\n\nsystems based on the behaviour of the brain. The functional connectivity, which does not carry information related to the directionality of the information transfer, could be used to describe the interactions between these patches of cortices. Neurons pass signals very fast (i.e even with a speed greater than 100ms−1 sometimes) compared to the time window chosen in imaging (which varies from 0.3s − 4s depending on the type of the image). Therefore, even though there is a directionality in the interactions of the patches of cortices, the functional connectivity can be used because we are studying the interactions in a time window over which the eﬀects of directionality might be washed away. Thus a brief explanation about the functional connectivity will be provided in the next section, followed by an explanation about the anatomical (structural) connectivity.\n\n2.2.1 Functional Connectivity\nFunctional connectivity in the brain is a concept that is still up for debate in neuroscience related research. However, the most popular deﬁnition used especially in fMRI is that functional connectivity in the brain is the correlation between spatially separated neurophysiological units or in other words patches of cortices [4]. The measured temporal correlation of the activity of these patches of cortices is considered to be the signature of functional connectivity. These correlations emerge from the task-speciﬁc patches of cortices, which have emergent properties that individual neurons do not have [5].\n\nThat being said, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a good tool discussed so far that could be used to understand the insights of functional connectivity. In fMRI, a Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal is recorded from a volumetric pixel (voxel) with an average size of 55 mm3. Following the statistics, this voxel contains 5.5 million neurons and 2 − 5 × 1010 synapses [6]. Thus, the BOLD time variation observed for a single voxel in fMRI results due to a population of neurons, instead of a single neuron. Then, the emerging question is, will this spatial resolution be enough to understand the functional connectivity of\n\n8\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\nthe brain? The answer depends on the scale of the problem that we are looking at. If we want to understand the functional connectivity in the scale of a patch of cortex, instead of the single neuronal level, the given fMRI spatial resolution could be used. Using that, the mean activity of a group of neurons can be captured. This could be relevant to understand phenomena like consciousness, which also emerges from a collective behaviour of neurons.\n\n2.2.2 Structural Connectivity\nStructural connectivity provides details about the connections the neurons or the patch of cortices in the brain hold. In other words, it gives the structure of the neuronal connections. The interconnectivity pattern of the brain at the neuronal level is one of the most complex environments. Its complexity varies from the single neuronal level to the connections of brain regional levels through diﬀerent models of connectivity. Studying structural connectivity at the neuronal level or micro-scale, has not been feasible due to its complexity. It might not be necessary either, as there is an enormous degree of conﬁrmation for the fact that the cognitive functions of humans depend on the collective activity of large populations of neurons, instead of individual neurons [7]. In addition to this, it is known there are momentary plastic changes in neuronal levels including structural remodelling [8, 9]. There is much variability associated with the connections at the micro-scale and these variabilities could be multiplied by orders of billions as there are as many neurons in the brain. Thus, we focus on structural connectivity in more technically feasible, as well as meaningful, level of scale. In fact, there are wide ranges of experimental techniques at the macro-scale that could be used to study the pathways among brain regions. One of the techniques is Diﬀusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which we used for this research and will be discussed further in this context. As a brief note, DTI captures the tracks of white matter in the brain using the diﬀusion of water molecules. However, structural connectivity is a critical determinant of the dynamics of the brain. In contrast, the functional behaviour of the brain has the ability to redesign the anatomical structure during developmental stages [10].\n\n2.3. Brain Imaging\n\n9\n\n2.3 Brain Imaging\nBrain imaging is an important portion of research in several ﬁelds, including biology, physics and psychology. There are lot of ongoing research for the development of diﬀerent brain imaging techniques. Some of them include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Diﬀusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). We are interested in fMRI and DTI because we are investigating the relationship between the structure and the function of the brain. Therefore, fMRI and DTI techniques will be discussed further.\n2.3.1 Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)\nFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), is an MRI technique that is being used to measure the functional behaviour of the brain by measuring the BOLD signal. Since the discovery of fMRI in the 1990s, it has been a very popular method for brain imaging for several reasons. One reason is that it does not require the injection of radioactive substances into the brain as in PET. Another reason is that the fMRI technique has better spatial resolution than PET [11]. However, there are basic hardware requirements in MRI devices. First and foremost, it should have a magnet capable of having high magnetic ﬁeld strengths. This magnet acquire its strength by an external power supply. Next, it should contain a gradient coil that can produce a ﬁeld gradient. The gradient coil produces a secondary magnetic ﬁeld when the current passes through it, which will distort the main magnetic ﬁeld. This allows the spatial identiﬁcation of the MR signal. Furthermore, there should be a radio frequency coil that can transmit and receive radio frequency oscillations, and a computer to acquire signals and compose the MR images [12]. A schematic diagram of these components in an MRI device is shown in Figure 2.2.\n\n10\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\nFigure 2.2: Main components of an MRI system. Image courtesy of the National Magnetic Field Laboratory [2]\nThe MRI signal is generated from the highly abundant protons in brain tissues in the form of water or fat. Depending on the amount of protons in the tissue, the strength of the MR signal varies. In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic moments of these protons are randomly oriented. When a strong magnetic ﬁeld is applied, they interact with the applied ﬁeld and partially align with the ﬁeld behaving like tiny bar magnets. Due to this alignment, a small amount of magnetization is created. Then using a radio frequency signal, a perturbation is introduced to these protons and when it is removed, the protons will take some time (relaxation time) to reposition. In the meantime, the observed magnetization will vary and it will gives rise to a detectable signal in the MRI device. If the relaxation time is long, then the MR signal will be strong and it will be weak otherwise.\nThe MRI technique was extended to fMRI in order to obtain information about the biological functions of the brain in the 1990s [13]. The basic principle of the fMRI is deﬁned as the detection of changes in the level of oxygen in the blood. This is called the BOLD eﬀect. When\n\n2.3. Brain Imaging\n\n11\n\nthere is neuronal activation in the brain, the blood ﬂow into that activated area increases as demanded by neurons to supply energy [14]. The energy needed is provided by supplying more oxygenated blood. Thus, when a set of neurons activates, more oxyhaemoglobin (which is diamagnetic) is delivered than deoxyhaemoglobin (which is paramagnetic). Oxyhaemoglobin can be magnetized by applying an external magnetic ﬁeld, in the same direction as the external ﬁeld (diamagnetic), and deoxyhaemoglobin can be magnetized by applying an external magnetic ﬁeld, in the opposite direction of the external ﬁeld (paramagnetic). Thus, the increase of oxyhaemoglobin concentration will reduce the local magnetic ﬁeld with a corresponding increase in the MRI signal [15].\n\nWhen the imaging techniques are being used, ﬁrst the brain is divided into voxels, and data are recorded for each of these voxels. There are millions of neurons in each of the voxels that are collectively responsible for the observed BOLD signal. This signal oscillates with time as shown in Figure 2.3. This particular time course was acquired from a brain at rest where the subject was instructed to have eyes closed and not to be involved in any mental task.\n\n12\n15\n\nChapter 2.

Imaging techniques have been developed with more research and, in 1994, the ﬁrst measurement of the diﬀusion tensor in the human brain was made [16]. Following that ﬁnding, Diﬀusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) was developed step by step to the point that now axonal ﬁbers can be tracked in the human brain in an accurate manner. DTI is considered a very reliable method to observe the micro-structural changes in the brain, and it is becoming a popular technique because of its high sensitivity to the changes at that level. However, there is continuous development to increase the accuracy and the spatial resolution of DTI.\nThe fundamental principle behind DTI is the measurement of diﬀusion (the microscopic random movements) of water molecules along the axonal ﬁbers in the brain. Diﬀusion of water is considered because water is an essential, as well as commonly present, source in our\n\n2.3. Brain Imaging\n\n13\n\nbodies, and 50-75% of the volume of our bodies is made up of water, reaching 75% in the brain. This huge amount of water is distributed in blood, bones and tissues in the body, but the amount of water the bones have is much less than that in blood or tissues. Due to the high abundance of water in tissues, it is a helpful substance to track down information about the micro-structure of the human body.\n\nWater molecules diﬀuse as a result of thermal ﬂuctuations. This diﬀusion is stimulated by an applied magnetic ﬁeld gradient and at the same time by interactions with neighbouring molecules or atoms as well as interactions between molecules and cell membranes. Additionally, it is inﬂuenced by the structure of these cells containing water [17]. As diﬀusion depends on the structure, it is possible to visualize the diﬀusion of water inside the axons as well as along the ﬁbers, giving us the opportunity to track down the path of diﬀusion. White matter is one type of matter in the brain which is made up of the axons of neurons in which water molecules can diﬀuse more freely along the ﬁber than across the ﬁber. Thus, the studies of diﬀusion in white matter will result in white matter tracts or ﬁber pathways. This kind of result could provide valuable information about the biological micro-structures of the brain [17].\n\nOut of the several techniques available, one of the most commonly used DTI technique is pulsed-gradient, spin-echo pulse sequence, echo-planar imaging [18]. It is an MR technique that uses an additional magnetic ﬁeld gradient. As described in the previous section, a strong homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is applied continuously to acquire the MR image. In DTI, the homogeneity of the magnetic ﬁeld is disturbed using two magnetic ﬁeld gradients of opposite directions, applied one after the other with a time delay. When the ﬁrst linear magnetic ﬁeld gradient is applied, the precession frequency of the protons will change depending on the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient. When it is removed, protons will have diﬀerent phases. Then the next magnetic ﬁeld gradient is applied with the same magnitude but in the opposite direction to refocus the phases of protons. In between the application of these two pulses, if\n\n14\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\nthe protons’ movement is restricted, the second gradient will allow them to be refocused to the same phase again. Thus the produced MR signal will be strong. However, if the water diﬀuses in this time gap, the second gradient will not be able to restore the phase shifts that have been created by the ﬁrst gradient. Thus, it will produce a weak MR signal [19]. To produce a complete signal using this technique, the diﬀusion gradient is applied to all the x, y and z directions in DTI. Afterwards, applying the ﬁber tractography [20] technique to this diﬀusion data, the details about the physical connections in the micro-structure of the brain could be extracted. Figure 2.4 indicates the ﬁber tract orientation of the default mode network of the brain.\n\nFigure 2.4: Lateral view of the white matter tracts in the brain, created by DTI. The colors, red, blue and green represent the ﬁbers along the x, y and z directions respectively in the cartesian coordinates (DR Paula et al. in prep.)\n2.4 Modelling the Brain\n2.4.1 Kuramoto Model\nThe Kuramoto model was introduced by Yoshiki Kuramoto and used to model the synchronization of coupled phase oscillators [21]. Phase oscillators are a type of oscillator whose\n\n2.4. Modelling the Brain\n\n15\n\nstates lie in the path of a circle where the phase is a variable. The model considers N number of coupled phase oscillators with natural frequencies distributed in space with a deﬁned probability density. The model considers two states, synchronized and anti-synchronized states. In the synchronized state, all the phase oscillators, oscillate with the same frequency and in the anti-synchronized state, they oscillate with diﬀerent frequencies. The objective of the Kuramoto model is to explain how the synchronized state and the anti-synchronized state of these phase oscillators can be distinguished starting with a group of unsynchronized phase oscillators. These oscillators try to oscillate with their natural frequencies, but the coupling between them always trys to synchronize the oscillations [22]. The globally coupled oscillators are deﬁned in the model using equation 2.1:\n\nθ˙i\n\n=\n\nωi\n\n+\n\nK N\n\nN\nsin(θ j − θi)\nj=1\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere θi (θ˙i) and ωi are the phase (rate of change of the phase) and the natural frequency of the ith oscillator respectively, and N is the total number of oscillators in the system, while K is a constant related to the coupling in the system. There are some assumptions in the analysis of the Kuramoto model which are:\n1. All the oscillators are globally coupled (each oscillator aﬀects every other oscillator).\n\n2. Oscillators are identical except for their diﬀerent natural frequencies [23].\nUsing this model, it has been found that there is a critical value for the coupling in the system, and this critical value Kc, is such that for K < Kc the probability of the system being synchronized is much less and when K increases past the Kc the number of oscillators synchronized increases until all of them are synchronized [24]. This critical value was able to identify a transition between an unsynchronized state and a synchronized state. However, the critical coupling constant depends on the distribution of the natural frequencies of oscillators, which adds another variability to the model.\n\n16\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\nNevertheless, the Kuramoto model has provided a mathematical basis to model some important phenomena in real life, like simulations of neurons in the brain by modeling the observed oscillations in the BOLD signal. It is used to study some behavioural aspects of neurons because of the limited variability of the states it has. Additionally, a synchronized behaviour was also observed in neurons in the brain [25], which motivates the use of the Kuramoto model to describe the synchronization phenomena in the brain. However, the outstanding problem is that the model talks about a system that has a constant coupling parameter together with sinusoidal phase oscillations as is stated under the assumptions above. In addition to that, according to the Kuramoto model, the natural frequencies of the oscillators follow the same distribution all the time, which might not be applicable to the neural activations of the brain.\n\nGeneralized Kuramoto Model\nSince the Kuramoto model was ﬁrst introduced, it has been used in several areas of research, including studying biological systems like the brain. When using the Kuramoto model to model the dynamics of the brain, Deco and his group introduced some advancements to generalize the model in order to better capture the eﬀects of structural connectivity in the brain [26]. Two changes they introduced to overcome the above indicated drawbacks and to generalize the Kuramoto model were:\n1. The coupling strength between each pair of oscillators was extracted using the white matter tracks of the brain. In other words, it was extracted from the structural connectivity of the brain instead of being considered a constant.\n2. The time delays of the oscillators were being scaled using the structural distance between the corresponding regions of the brain.\n\nBy applying these changes to the original Kuramoto model, Deco et al. generated a relationship between the generalized Kuramoto model and the brain without keeping it completely\n\n2.4. Modelling the Brain\n\n17\n\nisolated from the brain. Thus modelling the brain dynamics using the generalized Kuramoto model became more relevant.\n\n2.4.2 Ising model\nTwo dimensional (2D) Classical Ising Model\nThe classical Ising model was introduced by Wilhelm Lenz in 1920. The 1D Ising model was solved by his student, Ernest Ising, in 1925, and the 2D Ising model (in the absence of an external magnetic ﬁeld) was solved by Onsager in 1944 [27]. The 2D Ising model was introduced to explain the interactions of magnetic spins mathematically. The physical system (a magnet) is represented by a lattice conﬁguration in the Ising model. Each lattice site has a spin ’s’ which could take only two possible values, either up (+1) or down (−1) (Figure 2.5). Thus, it is a collection of +1 and −1s representing the spins. This conﬁguration is kept in a thermal bath of temperature T. Interactions between the spins are always inﬂuenced by this temperature and allow the system to reach an equilibrium energy state while resulting in diﬀerent equilibrium spin conﬁgurations with diﬀerent properties at diﬀerent temperatures.\n\n18\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\nFigure 2.5: Representation of a two-dimensional lattice arrangement. Each lattice site has a spin, either up or down. The nearest neighbours of the lattice site in green are represented in red.\n\nThe energy of this spin system at any state x in the absence of an external magnetic ﬁeld can be calculated using Equation 2.2:\n\nN\n\nE(x) = −J\n\nsi s j\n\ni, j=nn(i)\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere J is the coupling constant, si and s j represent the spins of the ith and jth site respectively, and N is the size of the lattice. For the calculation of energy in the Ising model, only the nearest neighbour interactions are considered together with equal coupling (J = 1). The probability of ﬁnding the system in the state x with energy E(x) is given by Equation 2.3:\n\nE(x)\n\nP(x) =\n\n1\n\n−\ne kBT\n\n(2.3)\n\nZ\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of the heat bath and Z is the partition function. Equation 2.4 illustrates the partition function of the system which describes the statistical properties of the spin system in thermodynamic equilibrium. The summation is over\n\n2.4. Modelling the Brain\n\n19\n\nall possible 2N spin conﬁgurations.\n\nE(x)\n−\nZ = e kBT\n{x}\n\n(2.4)\n\nWhen a 2D lattice conﬁguration is considered, there are two extreme equilibrium conﬁgurations of spins it can hold, one for lower temperatures and the other one for higher temperatures. When the temperature is very low, all the spins can be aligned along the same direction, with very large clusters of the same spin, either up or down (ordered) resulting in high magnetization even in the absence of an external magnetic ﬁeld (Figure 2.6 (a)). In the other end, when the temperature is very high, the spins are a mixture of up spins as well as down spins (disordered) without any order which will result in zero magnetization (Figure 2.6 (c)). In between these two extremes of temperature, there exists a critical temperature (Tc) [3] where the system exhibits transition from ordered phase to the disordered phase (Figure 2.6 (b)). As the ﬁgure illustrates, at this temperature there is a mixture of ordered spins as well as disordered spins. Additionally, the system acquires its maximum susceptibility or the maximum change in magnetization at Tc. Even a single spin ﬂip can change the entire system [28], and the perturbation introduced by a single spin ﬂip can spread over the entire system rapidly. Therefore, with different temperatures of the heat bath, the system could exhibit completely diﬀerent properties [27] which depend only on the temperature of the system.\n\n20\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\nFigure 2.6: Representation of the equilibrium spin conﬁguration for (a) T < Tc, (b) T = Tc and (c) T > Tc for a two-dimensional lattice arrangement. Red color is for the up spins (+1) and blue color is for the down spins (−1) [3].\nTo simulate the dynamics of the classical Ising model, the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is used. The Metropolis algorithm involves the construction of a new state based on the current state of the system with a transition probability. It is used in the Ising model to ﬁnd the equilibrium energy state starting from a random spin conﬁguration for a constant temperature. Monte Carlo simulations are used to describe or to solve systems which change in time without any predeﬁned dynamical pattern but depending on random numbers created along the simulations [29]. These algorithms are used in the classical Ising model with the periodic boundary conditions. Periodic boundary conditions were introduced to the system to restrain the ﬁnite size eﬀects. The application of these algorithms in order to construct the equilibrium spin states, and then the time ﬂuctuations of the spins for a range of temperatures, will be discussed in detail in the methodology section (Chapter 3).\nAn important question that arises next is why it is possible to use the dynamics of the Ising model which were introduced by using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm to explain the dynamics of the brain. In the simplest way, spins of the Ising model can be considered as equivalent to the BOLD activity in the brain with +1 for the activity higher than the baseline activity and −1 for the activity lower than the baseline activity. Additionally, it is a very sim-\n\n2.4. Modelling the Brain\n\n21\n\nple model that explains the phase separation. Furthermore, Fraiman et al. [30] state the Ising model can be used to explain the behaviour of the brain at the critical temperature because of the similarities it has shown in its dynamics and the brain’s spatio-temporal patterns. The classical Ising model exhibits long range correlations at the critical temperature, which explains the observed interactions of the spins that are spatially distant from each other. This fact can be compared with the functional integration observed in the brain. The brain maintains a balance between the functional integration and segregation in order to perform eﬃciently. As observed in the behaviour of the brain, there are separate regions which are specialized to perform certain functions. While functioning separately, these regions need to exchange information with each other in order to function as a complete system. This process is explained as the functional integration and can be compared with the long range correlations observed in the Ising model. Thus the classical Ising model was chosen to model the oscillations observed in BOLD signal for comparison.\n\nGeneralized Ising model\nThe generalized Ising model is an advancement from the classical Ising model. The generalization was performed by including the information related to the structure of the brain in the classical Ising model following the work of Marinazzo et al. [31]. They implemented the generalized Ising model by using the structural connectivity of the brain, without introducing the dynamics to the spins variables. By analysing the results they claimed that, the total information transfer between spin variables in the model is maximized at the critical state. Similarly, we implement the generalized Ising model using the structural connectivity; but in addition, we introduce the dynamics to the spins using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. The methodology will be discussed in details in Chapter 3. However, there are two diﬀerences between the classical Ising model and the generalized Ising model.\n\n22\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\n1. According to the generalized Ising model, all the lattice points are interacting with all the other lattice points with diﬀerent strengths. This is true in the sense of the structure of the brain. In the brain, there are some regions that are highly structurally connected with larger numbers of ﬁbers and some regions that are poorly connected.\n\n2. When using Equation 2.5 to calculate the energy of the system, normalized structural information is used for Ji j instead of equal coupling as in the classical Ising model (explained in detail in Chapter 3). Due to this modiﬁcation, the strength of connection held between two regions is taken into account by the generalized Ising model.\n\nThese two points are illustrated in Equation 2.5:\n\nN\nE(x) = − Ji j si s j\ni, j;i j\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere Ji j is the coupling constant between the ith site and the jth site. The summation is over all the sites, without the restriction of the nearest neighbour coupling as in the classical Ising model.\n\nHowever, due to these two modiﬁcations, the spin sites in the generalized Ising model has a one-to-one relationship with the patches of cortices in the brain. Hence, it could be used to study the dynamics of the brain not only on a global level, but also on a local level. Nevertheless, the classical Ising model, as described earlier, is a 2-dimensional model, and each spin site has four nearest neighbours. But in the generalized Ising model, we propose that each region is connected with every other region, resulting in each site having n - 1 (number of regions 1) nearest neighbours. This makes the model more realistic because, as it is understood from the structural connectivity data of the brain, there are connections between most of the regions and not just between the nearest neighbours. Notice that, the dimension of the generalized Ising model is unknown. However, in order to extract the eﬀective dimension of the model, the\n\n2.4. Modelling the Brain\n\n23\n\ncritical exponents could be studied at the criticality.\n\nAll the observables in the classical Ising model behave according to the Equation 2.6 when reaching the critical temperature, as explained by Lilian and Manuel in [32]:\n\nO(T ) ∝| T − Tc | α Tc\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere O(T ) is any observable, α is the critical exponent and Tc is the critical temperature. Thus, we could ﬁnd the critical exponents for all the observables, such as the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, speciﬁc heat, correlation function and correlation length. Those critical exponents should follow the scaling relations given in Equation 2.7 as described in [32]:\n\n(2 − η)ν = γ\n\nν (η + d − 2) = β\n\n(2.7)\n\n2\n\n2 − νd = α\n\nwhere β, γ, α, η, ν are the critical exponents of magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, speciﬁc heat, correlation function and correlation length, while d is the dimension of the system. Therefore, by extracting the critical exponents of the generalized Ising model, we will be able to ﬁnd the dimensionality d of the generalized Ising model (Das et al., in prep.) using the above scaling relations.\n\n2.4.3 Generalized Kuramoto Model versus Generalized Ising model\nAs explained in the previous sections, the Kuramoto model takes a network of coupled oscillators into account and ﬁnds a critical point in between the unsynchronized and synchronized states of these coupled oscillators. The Ising model takes a spin conﬁguration into account and ﬁnds a critical state where the phase transition of the spins occurs from the ordered to disor-\n\n24\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\ndered phase. Both of these phenomena at the critical states are compared with the dynamics of the brain even though there is no one-to-one relationship between either of the oscillator or the spin lattice sites and the position of the patch of cortex in the brain.\n\nSometime after the introduction of the Kuramoto model, it was generalized such that the coupled oscillators represent the structural regions of the brain, as described in section 2.4.1. The generalized Kuramoto model could give a detailed explanation of the functional networks of the brain, starting with the structural connectivity [33]. However, as Deco et al. [26] explained in the paper, the generalized Kuramoto model still has four main free parameters, which are mean delay, global coupling strength and two standard deviations from two Gaussian distributions (one modelled for the dispersion of oscillation frequencies and the other one modelled for the noise of the local networks). Similarly, we are generalizing the Ising model using the anatomical structure of the brain in place of the constant coupling in the classical Ising model; but the model has only one controlling parameter, the temperature of the heat bath.\n\n2.5 Graph Theory\nGraph theory is a mathematical tool that can be used to study networks with complex topologies. It reveals important information about the connectivities in terms of single units and sub groups as well as a complete network. Graph theory has been used broadly to study highly complex networks like the internet and air craft ﬂight patterns as it is a simple tool, which explains the complexity of the subjected networks. Therefore, we use graph theoretical analysis of the complex brain network. In this context, a graph is a network with source nodes and edges that connect the nodes. Using graph theory to analyse the complex network of the brain simpliﬁes the analysis and provides a more general understanding. As Bullmore and Sporns reviewed [34], the increasing demand of analysing more complex network structures is very\n\n2.5. Graph Theory\n\n25\n\nwell handled by the use of graph theory. The equivalent of an edge in a graph could be explained by a structural or functional connection in the brain network and a node by a region or a collection of regions in the brain. There are several measures in graph theory being used to study this complex connectivity.\n\nThe degree of a node in the network is one of the simplest measures. It is deﬁned as the number of links a node has and can be calculated using Equation 2.8:\n\nki = ai j\njN\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere ki is the degree of the ith node, N is the number of nodes in the network and ai j is the connection status between the ith node and the jth node (it is equal to 1 if the nodes are connected and 0 if they are not, in a binary network) [35]. The degree averaged over all the nodes is deﬁned as the global degree of that network. An understanding about how dense or sparse the network is could be gained from the average degree of the network.\n\nFollowing that, we calculated the eﬃciency for these networks, which is discussed as a\n\nmeasure of functional integration. The global eﬃciency of a binary network can be calculated\n\nusing Equation 2.9:\n\nEFF = 1 n\n\nEFFi\n\n=\n\n1 n\n\niN\n\niN\n\nj N, j i di−j1 n−1\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere EFFi is the local eﬃciency, di j is the shortest path length between nodes i and j and\n\nn is the total number of nodes in the network [36]. The eﬃciency of a network provides an\n\nunderstanding about the information propagation through the network, or in other words, the\n\nability of the network to handle information integration.\n\n26\n\nChapter 2. Background & related work\n\nEquation 2.10 was used to calculate the small-world property for each network:\n\nS\n\n=\n\nC/Crand L/Lrand\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere C and Crand are the clustering coeﬃcients, and L and Lrand are the characteristic path lengths of the network being tested and a random network respectively. A random network is created by preserving the degree distribution of the tested network. Small-world networks are characterized by the average short path lengths and high clustering coeﬃcients [37]. It is a measure of the balance between information integration and segregation. Average path length is a measure of integration which is deﬁned as the average of shortest distance between each pair of nodes. Clustering coeﬃcient is a measure of the segregation or in other words it measures the tendency of the nodes to cluster together. In neuroscience, it has been shown in several analyses that the brain network shows small-world network properties, implying that it maintains a balance between integration and segregation. Small-world networks often have values greater than 1 for S [38, 35]; but the value of S could easily be misinterpreted without knowing about the connectivity of the network. For an example, the average path length can be very small for networks with lower number of edges and lower number of participating nodes. Although the clustering coeﬃcient can be high for these type of networks because of the small number of nodes in the network. This can result in higher small-world property which stands for an eﬃcient network with a well balanced information integration and segregation.\n\nChapter 3\nMethodology\n3.1 Overview\nIn this chapter, we focus on the procedure for generating the two types of data sets we used: brain data and simulations. In the ﬁrst section, we would like to focus on the method of extraction of the functional brain data from fMRI. The methodology used for the acquisition and extraction of structural data using DTI will then be explained, followed by a section with a detailed explanation of numerical simulations of the models. The acquisition and preprocessing of fMRI data and DTI data was performed by Erik Ziegler (University of Liege, Liege, Belgium). In section 3.3, we will describe the methodology for the simulation of the generalized Ising model. The simulations of the classical Ising model will be described after that followed by a description of the methodology used for the analysis of these data.\n3.2 Empirical Data from MRI\n3.2.1 Subjects\nFor the collection of data, 14 healthy subjects with mean age 43 ± 15 were studied, including seven women. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical School of the\n27\n\n28\n\nChapter 3. Methodology\n\nUniversity of Liege. In addition, informed approval to participate in the study was obtained from all the subjects. From these healthy subjects, the resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) and DTI data were acquired and preprocessed using the methods described below.\n\n3.2.2 Acquisition & Preprocessing\nFunctional Data\nResting state BOLD data were acquired on a 3-T MR scanner with a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence using axial slice orientation and covering the whole brain (32 slices, voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm3; matrix size 64 × 64 × 32; repetition time = 2000 ms; echo time = 30 ms; ﬂip angle = 780). Data preprocessing was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) 8 (www.ﬁl.ion.ac.uk/spm). Preprocessing steps included realignment and adjustment for movement related eﬀects, co-registration of functional images with structural images, segmentation of structural data, spatial and functional normalization and spatial smoothing of the fMRI data.\n\nSegmentation of images for each subject was performed with the FreeSurfers DesikanKilliany atlas [39]. This atlas provides the ability to separate the brain into gyral-based regions of interest (ROI) automatically. Thus using the atlas, the images could be segmented. Further parcellation, using the Lausanne 2008 atlas and its 83 individually labelled regions, was done with functions from the Connectome Mapping Toolkit [40, 41, 42]. The labels of the 83 regions are presented in Appendix C followed by a ﬁgure representing the 83 regions (Figure .3).\nStructural Data\nDiﬀusion Weighted Images (DWI) were acquired from each subject, and the Fractional Anisotropy (FA) maps which quantify diﬀusion-weighted eﬀects at the voxel level were generated. After\n\n3.3. Numerical Simulations\n\n29\n\nthat, orientation distribution functions were obtained for each voxel. Probabilistic tractography [43] was performed throughout the whole brain using randomly placed seeds inside a subject-speciﬁc white-matter mask. The set of points representing each ﬁber track were then aﬃne-transformed into the subjects’ structural spaces which results in the connectivity maps. Finally, connectivity matrices with the number of ﬁbers connecting each of the 83 regions with all the others were obtained for 14 subjects, and the normalized mean connectivity was used as an input of the generalized Ising model.\n\n3.2.3 Resting State Network (RSN) extraction\nAfter using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [44] for BOLD decomposition in an independent data set of 19 healthy controls, nine Resting State Networks (RSNs) were identiﬁed in each subject, and an average template was created for each RSN. Subsequently, by setting a separate threshold for each RSN, the region of interests (ROIs) out of the 83 parcellated regions belonging to the network were extracted. Extracted ROIs for each network are presented in Appendix D. Finally, the lines of the correlation matrix corresponding to each ROI for the same RSN were averaged in order to obtain the linear-correlation maps plotted in Figure 4.9.\n\n3.3 Numerical Simulations\n3.3.1 Generalized Ising Model\nThe generalized Ising model was developed by starting with a 1D-random spin conﬁguration of lattice of size 83, which is assumed to be in contact with a thermal bath of temperature T. The steps below have been followed according to the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm to obtain the equilibrium spin conﬁguration, for a particular temperature starting with random spin states. The connectivity matrix used for the simulation of the generalized Ising model is presented in Figure 3.1 (c).\n\n30\n\nChapter 3. Methodology\n\n1. A random spin conﬁguration was deﬁned with the lattice size of 83.\n\n2. Initial energy Ein of the system was calculated using Equation 2.5. 3. Next, one spin was selected randomly from the spin conﬁguration and was ﬂipped.\n\n4. The new energy Enew was calculated.\n5. Then Ein and Enew were compared.\n• If Enew < Ein, the spin ﬂip was accepted and the new conﬁguration was considered the initial conﬁguration with Ein = Enew. Then the simulation was continued starting from Step 3. ∆E\n−\n• If Enew > Ein, the Boltzmann factor B = e kBT was calculated and a random number r was drawn from a normal distribution. Then these two values were compared. – If B > r, the spin ﬂip was accepted and Ein was replaced with Enew. Then the procedure was repeated starting from Step 3. – If B < r, the spin ﬂip was rejected, and the simulation was started over from Step 3.\n\nThe steps starting from Step 3 were repeated until we obtained an equilibrium spin conﬁguration with an equilibrium energy for a particular temperature. At the equilibrium state, energy of the system ﬂuctuates within a small range. The random conﬁguration can evolve into this state by following single-spin-ﬂip dynamics as explained in the algorithm. This equilibrium conﬁguration was considered as the conﬁguration at time t = 0. After that, by following the Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations, the time evolution of the equilibrium spin conﬁguration was obtained as follows;\n• Equilibrium spin conﬁguration = the conﬁguration at time t = 0.\n\n3.3. Numerical Simulations\n\n31\n\n• Next, all the spins in the conﬁguration were tested for ﬂip by ﬂipping one at a time and comparing Ein and Enew to decide whether to accept or to reject the ﬂip using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. After all the spins had been checked, the new conﬁguration was considered the conﬁguration at time t = 1.\n• After that, all the spins of this new conﬁguration were checked for ﬂip as in the previous step. When all the spins had been checked, the new conﬁguration was taken as the conﬁguration at time t = 2.\n• These steps were repeated until we found as many time points as needed to compare with the empirical data.\n\nBy the end of this process, the time evolution of the spins for each spin site was obtained.\n\nUsing these time series data, and Equation 3.1, the correlation between each pair of sites in the\n\nlattice was calculated:\n\nρi j\n\n=\n\n<\n\nsi(t)s j(t)\n\n> − < si(t) σsi(t)σs j(t)\n\n><\n\ns j(t)\n\n>\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere ρi j is the correlation between the ith and jth spin time series, si(t) and s j(t) stands for the\n\nspin time courses of the ith and jth region, σ2si(t) = < s2i (t) > − < si(i) >2 and < . > is the average over time.\n\nStarting from a random conﬁguration, this complete procedure was repeated for diﬀerent temperatures ”T” ranging from 0.5 to 3 in increments of 0.01. Additionally, kB was equated to one, in the simulations. This was repeated for ten iterations, and data were recorded separately each time. We performed the simulation for ten iterations to observe the eﬀect of randomization of the spins at the ﬁrst step of the simulations. An illustration of the variation with respect to the iteration is presented in Figure .1 in the Appendix B.\n\n32\n\nChapter 3. Methodology\n\nFigure 3.1: Connectivity matrices used for the simulations of the classical Ising model (a) 9 × 9 , (b) 10 × 10, and (c) the generalized Ising model.\n\nDuring these simulations, the energy (E), magnetization (M) and susceptibility (χ) of the system were calculated using Equations 2.5, 3.2 and 3.3 respectively at each temperature:\n\nM=\n\n1 N\n\nN i=1\n\nsi\n\n(3.2)\n\nχ = 1 [< M2 > − < M >2]\n\n(3.3)\n\nNT\n\nwhere N = 83 and si is the spin of the ith region. Derivation of Equation 3.3 is presented in [45]. These quantities were plotted as a function of temperature, and the susceptibility versus\n\ntemperature plot was used to extract the critical temperature (Tc), which gives the highest susceptibility. Super critical (T > Tc) and sub critical (T < Tc) temperatures were chosen relative to the critical temperature. The MATLAB code which was used for the simulations of\n\nthe generalized Ising model is attached in Appendix A.\n\n3.3.2 2D Classical Ising Model\nThe classical Ising model was developed by following the same steps, and using Equation 2.2 instead of Equation 2.5 to calculate energy, which includes equal coupling as well as only the\n\n3.4. Comparison of data\n\n33\n\nnearest neighbour interactions. The 2D Ising model was simulated using two lattice sizes 9 × 9 (L = 9) & 10 × 10 (L = 10) which result in 81 and 100 spin sites respectively. These two sizes were chosen to make the 2D Ising model comparable with the empirical data, which has 83 spin sites. Given this choice, two separate data sets were obtained for each lattice size with temperature ranging from 0.5 to 4. The connectivity matrix used for the simulations of the classical Ising model is presented in Figure 3.1 (a) and (b).\n\nIn a similar manner, Equations 3.2 and 3.3 were used to calculate the magnetization and\n\nsusceptibility of the system, where N = L × L in the classical Ising model. After extracting the\n\ncritical temperature for both of the lattice sizes, those values were veriﬁed using Equation 3.4\n\n[32]:\n\nTc\n\n=\n\n(20.28)\n\n×\n\n1 L2\n\n+\n\n2.26\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere L is the length of the square lattice (either 9 or 10).\n\n3.4 Comparison of data\nAs explained in the previous sections, the functional correlation was obtained for the regional parcellation of 83 regions in the brain using rsfMRI, which will be hereafter called the empirical data. The structural connectivity was obtained by the extraction of white matter tracts from DTI. In addition to that, we generated three sets of data from the mathematical simulations of the Ising model: one from the generalized Ising model using the structural connectivity, and the other two sets from the classical Ising model for two diﬀerent lattice sizes.\nThe mean data over the ten iterations were considered to perform our analysis. A comparison of the correlations of the empirical data, generalized Ising model data and the classical Ising model data was performed ﬁrst. After observing the correlation maps for three diﬀerent temperatures, we calculated the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test statistic at each temperature\n\n34\n\nChapter 3.

The test statistic calculates the maximum distance between two cumulative distributions and this has been used to ﬁnd the temperature which minimizes the distance between two distributions in our data. Thereafter, graph theoretical measures as explained in Chapter 2 have been used to compare the classical Ising model and generalized Ising model data with the empirical data. The results will be presented in the next chapter.\n\nChapter 4 Results\n4.1 Overview\nIn this chapter, we will present our results obtained using the methodology explained in Chapter 3.\n4.2 The Classical Ising model versus the Generalized Ising model\nThree correlation data sets were obtained by following the procedure explained in Chapter 3.

Using these three plots, a new temperature T ∗, which minimizes the distance between two distributions of data was extracted for each model. T ∗ for the classical Ising model for 9 × 9 was 2.63 and for 10 × 10 was 2.58, and T ∗ for the generalized Ising model was 2.02.\n\nDistance\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n41\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\nTemperature\n\nFigure 4.3: KS test statistic for the classical Ising model with (a) 9 × 9 and (b) 10 × 10 lattice sizes and (c) the generalized Ising model as a function of temperature.

A range of thresholds were selected at ﬁrst to create the connectivity matrices. In Figure 4.6, the global degree is plotted as a function of the selected thresholds for the positive and negative correlations with respect to the two models. When the positive correlation is considered, the generalized Ising model shows a similar behaviour to the empirical data at T ∗.

That allows to determine which regions are connected and which are not connected. In these graphs, each point represents a brain region and in this study there were 83 regions. It can be seen that the connectivity in the network grows as the temperature reaches T ∗ and has reduced at T > T c. Furthermore, when the euclidean distances between these four graphs and the empirical graph were calculated, the connectivity graph at T ∗ resulted the lowest distance of 5.1 while the distances for the graphs at T < Tc, T = Tc and T > Tc resulted in 8.1, 7.1 and 7.0 respectively. The connectivity graphs could not be implemented for the classical Ising model as there was no one-to-one match between the regions of the classical Ising model and the regions of the brain.\n\n44\nT < Tc\n\nT = Tc\n\nChapter 4.

Using this simple model, it has been shown that a brain at rest could be simulated at the critical temperature of the model where the phase transition occurs [30]. This was justiﬁed by observing the behaviour of the model at the critical temperature which has a mixture of ordered and disordered states with long range correlations comparable with the brain’s information integration and segregation. Thus we chose the two dimensional square lattice Ising model in our simulations. The simulations include two lattice sizes, 9 × 9 and 10 × 10 which were chosen because they result in 81 and 100 spin sites respectively, which then could be compared with the brain’s 83 parcellations even though there is no one-to-one match. As expected, both of these conﬁgurations show the phase transition at the extracted critical temperature, which was validated with the prior results using the Equation 3.4 in Chapter 3.\nWe determined the critical temperature of the 2D classical Ising model from its magnetic susceptibility versus temperature graph as described in the methodology. The critical temperature value resulting from these plots agrees with the critical temperature described in [32] for the two lattice sizes 9 × 9 and 10 × 10. The behaviour of the energy and magnetization with temperature also agrees with previous results for the classical Ising model showing a phase\n46\n\n47\ntransition at the critical temperature.\nComparisons between the correlation in each model provide an overall insight into the data. As the classical Ising model is a more general model and does not have any spatial correspondence with the human brain, this model could be a good global measure by which to interpret the data. The nearest neighbour coupling is evident in the correlation maps of the classical Ising model shown in Figure 4.2. On the other hand, structural connectivity enhances the correlation patterns observed in the generalized Ising model in the same ﬁgure. As evident from the correlation maps, at T < Tc the correlations are almost zero which is controversial to the fact that at low temperatures the spin conﬁgurations are ordered. If they are ordered, they should be highly correlated in terms of the spin time series due to the fact that they are highly unlikely to ﬂip when tested for ﬂip. Thus there will not be a variation of the spins as a function of time. When we use the Equation 3.1 to calculate the correlation of such two time series, the result will be undeﬁned because of zero variance which is the denominator of the equation. To overcome this result, we added noise to the spin time series and when the correlation is calculated for such two noises it results in zero correlation, which explains the correlation maps for T < Tc. Furthermore, when the correlation maps of the generalized Ising model were analysed as a function of temperature, at Tc it did not provide a very good match with the empirical correlation. Thus, the distance between the correlation distributions were taken into account to ﬁnd a temperature that minimizes the distance between the two cumulative distributions, and the results suggest that temperature is greater than Tc for the generalized Ising model. The analysis was continued by considering Tc as well as the new temperature T ∗. The generalized Ising model gives a better match with the empirical correlation at T ∗ (Figure 4.4).\nAs expected, the distribution of the correlation in the classical Ising model shows a good match with the empirical data as it describes the global behaviour of the function. At Tc and T ∗ the models show some positive correlation that emphasizes the formation of clusters. From the\n\n48\n\nChapter 5. Discussion and Conclusions\n\nneurobiological perspective, neurons communicate with each other every second. The separate regions of the brain cannot work independently (even though they are structurally separated). Thus, they create clusters and networks to increase functional segregation, resulting in the positive correlation observed for the empirical data in Figure 4.5. On the other hand, the generalized Ising model does not show the expected behaviour at the critical temperature, which was determined from the susceptibility peak. However, it shows positive correlations as observed in empirical data at T ∗.\n\nWe followed a data driven strategy to extract the graph theoretical networks from the correlation data. To do this, a threshold has to be selected such that it will allow accurate visualization of the networks. Thus, the thresholds play an important role in creating the networks using the correlations. From Figure 4.6, it is evident that the higher the threshold, the sparser the network will be as the average degree reduces as a power law while the threshold increases. Even though the classical Ising model acquires the maximum possible degree at the critical temperature, or at T ∗ with zero threshold, the generalized Ising model and the empirical network do not achieve such. This veriﬁes the mixture of both positive and negative correlations observed for the fMRI data and generalized Ising model data in Figure 4.5. However, calculated global variables, such as the average degree and global eﬃciency, verify the match between the empirical data and the generalized Ising model at T ∗, resulting in the highest functional integration measures.\n\nAdditionally, small-worldness plotted as a function of temperature in Figure 4.7 provides conﬁrmation of the idea that the brain represents a small-world network with high clustering and low characteristic path lengths, representing high integration and segregation as described in [34, 35]. When the temperature reaches Tc for the classical Ising model and T ∗ for the generalized Ising model, both of the models converge to small-worldness as exhibited by the dynamical function of the brain. This small-world property depends on the clustering coeﬃ-\n\n49\ncient and the characteristic path length of the network being considered and a random network, as explained in Equation 2.10. The random network was created by preserving the degree distribution of the tested network to calculate the small-worldness. To explain the behaviour of the small-world property, clustering coeﬃcients and the average path lengths are plotted as a function of temperature in Figure .2 in Appendix B. As the ﬁgure illustrates, even though the clustering coeﬃcient is the highest at Tc or T ∗ for the models, the ratio of C/Crand clearly shows a peak at a temperature less than Tc for the classical Ising model. However the ratio gives a minimum around Tc or T ∗. On the other hand, when we consider the average path length, it clearly minimizes at Tc or T ∗ as expected. Nevertheless, due to a higher number of nodes governed by few connections, the average distance increases in the T < Tc region. These facts result in the higher small-worldness for T Tc or T ∗ as seen in Figure 4.7.\nThe connectivity graphs of the generalized Ising model allow its visualization. When the graph at Tc and the graph of empirical data is compared, it is evident that the generalized Ising model does not exhibit similar behaviour with the empirical data as expected at the Tc (Figure 4.8). However, this implies that at T ∗ it creates more connections and the connectivity of the network is similar to that of the functional brain network. This result provides a platform for building the relationship between the structure and function of the brain, as the generalized Ising model was built based on structural connectivity (see the methodology).\nFurthermore, studies of the resting state of the brain have provided information regarding possible functionally specialized resting state networks (RSNs). Figure 4.9 shows the brain maps of those nine resting state networks for the empirical data as well as for the simulated data, which shows a direct correspondence between the two types of data at T ∗. Being able to extract these correlations with respect to the RSNs provide insight to the higher correlation lengths which allow the interactions between regions at a distance from each other, exhibited by the generalized Ising model. However, Figure 4.8 and 4.9 were created only for the gen-\n\n50\n\nChapter 5. Discussion and Conclusions\n\neralized Ising model as it takes the 83 parcellations of the brain into account and the classical Ising model does not have any correspondence with the spatial parcellations of the brain.\n\nEven though the Classical Ising model is able to explain the behaviour of the brain at the global level without any spatial speciﬁcation, we need a better model to predict the connectivity of the structure and the function of the brain in a spatially accountable manner. As introduced in this research, the generalized Ising model better predicts the functional behaviour of the brain in relation to spatial positions of the brain than the classical Ising model. Additionally, the generalized Ising model, together with graph theory, is proven to facilitate the understanding of the relationship between the structure and the function of the brain. However, as discussed, the generalized Ising model provides the best ﬁt for the empirical data at T ∗, which is diﬀerent from the critical temperature (Tc) which can be explained as below.\nAs observed in Figure 4.2, the classical Ising model resulted in positive correlations at Tc while the generalized Ising model had the majority of the correlations equal to zero at Tc. This was veriﬁed in Figure 4.5 with the mean of the distribution of correlation lying at zero for the generalized Ising model at Tc, while it was non-zero for the classical Ising model. However, at T ∗ the generalized Ising model was able to acquire the desired non-zero correlations similar to the empirical data (Figure 4.4), and the mean of the correlation distribution was shifted to 0.2 giving a better match with the empirical data which has a mean correlation of 0.3. Therefore, it could be suﬃcient to have only the critical temperature for the classical Ising model to obtain non-zero correlations as observed in the empirical data. However, to reproduce the behaviour of the empirical data the generalized Ising model should have an optimum temperature (T ∗) as well as a given structural connectivity.\n\n5.1. Future Directions\n\n51\n\n5.1 Future Directions\n\nThis research on the generalized Ising model was carried out together with graph theory only for healthy subjects. The results of this research demonstrate the possibility of applying this methodology to investigate the brain function of patients suﬀering from brain disorders due to severe brain injuries. The study would show the changes occurring in the functional activity of the brain through the changes in structural connectivity, which are extracted using DTI from patients. The comparison of the data between healthy subjects and patients would direct us to explore the connections necessary for rehabilitation of the injured brain. This could be very relevant in understanding the mechanism necessary to re-establish a normal structure-function relationship after injury and help in guiding the treatments for recovery of these patients.\n\nBibliography\n[1] Sarah N.
