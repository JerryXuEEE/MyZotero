This work focuses on the question of whether such state can be comparable to any known dynamical state. For that purpose, correlation networks from human brain functional magnetic resonance imaging are contrasted with correlation networks extracted from numerical simulations of the Ising model in two dimensions at different temperatures. For the critical temperature T c , striking similarities appear in the most relevant statistical properties, making the two networks indistinguishable from each other. These results are interpreted here as lending support to the conjecture that the dynamics of the functioning brain is near a critical point. \n \n    Figure \n    Figure \n    Figure \n    Figure \n    Figure \n    Figure \n    Figure  \n \n1 More \n \n    Received 10 December 2008 \n \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.79.061922 \n \n©2009 American Physical Society \nAuthors & Affiliations \n \nDaniel Fraiman 1 , Pablo Balenzuela 2 , Jennifer Foss 3 , and Dante R.
