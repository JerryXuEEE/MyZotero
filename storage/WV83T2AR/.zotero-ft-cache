Closer to critical resting-state neural dynamics

in individuals with higher ﬂuid intelligence

According to the critical brain hypothesis, the brain is considered to operate near criticality and realize efﬁcient neural computations. Despite the prior theoretical and empirical evidence in favor of the hypothesis, no direct link has been provided between human cognitive performance and the neural criticality. Here we provide such a key link by analyzing resting-state dynamics of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) networks at a whole-brain level. We develop a data-driven analysis method, inspired from statistical physics theory of spin systems, to map out the whole-brain neural dynamics onto a phase diagram. Using this tool, we show evidence that neural dynamics of human participants with higher ﬂuid intelligence quotient scores are closer to a critical state, i.e., the boundary between the paramagnetic phase and the spin-glass (SG) phase. The present results are consistent with the notion of “edge-of-chaos” neural computation.

Critical brain hypothesis posits that the brain operates near a critical regime, i.e., boundary between different phases showing qualitatively different behaviors1–6. This hypothesis has been investigated for more than two decades including criticisms such as the presence of alternative mechanisms explaining power law scaling in the relevant observables7–10. Experimental evidence such as the recovery of critical behavior after interventions, which is difﬁcult to explain by alternative mechanisms, lends supports to the hypothesis9.
Theoretical and experimental work has shown that neural systems operating near criticality are advantageous in information transmission, information storage, classiﬁcation, and nonlinear input ﬁltering1,3,5,11–14. These ﬁndings align with the idea of edge-of-chaos computation, with which computational ability of a system is maximized at a phase transition between a chaotic phase and a nonchaotic phase15–17. These ﬁndings are also in line with a general contention that cognitive computations occur as neural dynamical processes18,19.
A prediction from the critical brain hypothesis is that neural dynamics in individuals with higher cognitive abilities should be closer to criticality than in those with lower cognitive abilities. However, whether high cognitive skills are associated with criticality has not been empirically proven. In fact, recent emerging evidence suggests that human cognitive performance is associated with appropriate transitions between relatively discrete brain states during rest20–22, working memory tasks23, and visual perception tasks24. Furthermore, these and other studies18,19,25 support that state-transition dynamics in the brain involve largescale brain networks. These arguments are consistent with the proposal that many cognitive functions seem to depend on network connectivity among various regions scattered over the whole brain26. On these grounds, in the present study we hypothesize that complex and transitory neural dynamics of the brain network (i.e., dynamic transitions among discrete brain states) that are close to criticality are associated with high cognitive performance of humans.
Two major conventional methods for examining criticality and edge-of-chaos computation in empirical neural data are not capable of testing this hypothesis for their own reasons. First, many of the experimental studies testing the critical brain hypothesis have examined neuronal avalanches11,12, including the case of humans5,27,28. Neuronal avalanches are bursts of cascading activity of neurons, whose power-law properties have been related to criticality. However, studies of neuronal avalanches have focused on their scale-free dynamics in space and time, with which statistics of avalanches obey power laws. Scale-free dynamics of neuronal avalanches is a question orthogonal to patterns of transitions between discrete states. Second, nonlinear time series analysis has found that electroencephalography signals recorded from the brains of healthy controls are chaotic and that the degree of chaoticity is stronger for healthy controls than individuals with, for example, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia29. However, this method is not usually for interacting time series. Therefore, it does not directly reveal how different brain regions interact or whether possible critical or chaotic dynamics are an outcome of the dynamics at a single region or interaction among different regions.
In the present study, we develop a data-driven method to measure the extent to which neural dynamics obtained from largescale brain networks are close to criticality and complex statetransition dynamics. The method stands on two established ﬁndings. First, statistical mechanical theory of the Ising spinsystem model posits that the so-called spin-glass phase corresponds to rugged energy landscapes (and therefore, complex statetransition dynamics)30 and chaotic dynamics31–33. Therefore, we are interested in how close the given data are to dynamics in the

spin-glass phase. Second, the Ising model has been ﬁtted to various electrophysiological data6,34–36 and fMRI data recorded from a collection of regions of interest (ROIs)20,21,24,37,38 during rest or tasks with a high accuracy. Therefore, we start by ﬁtting the Ising model to the multivariate fMRI data. Then, we draw phase diagrams of functional brain networks at a whole-brain level. By construction, the dynamical behavior of the system is qualitatively distinct in different phases. The method determines the location of a brain in the phase diagram and thus tells us whether the largescale brain dynamics of individual participants are ordered, disordered, or chaotic (i.e., spin-glass) dynamics as well as how close the dynamics are to a phase transition curve, on which the system shows critical behavior.
We deploy this method to resting-state fMRI data recorded from human adults with different intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. As a cognitive ability of interest, we focus on ﬂuid intelligence, which refers to the ability to think logically and solve problems with a limited amount of task-related information39. Fluid intelligence is strongly related to the general intelligence factor, g39 and predictive of real-world outcomes such as job performance40. We examine our hypothesis that large-scale brain dynamics of individuals higher in the intelligence score that measures ﬂuid intelligence are closer to critical.

Results
Brain dynamics are close to the spin-glass phase transition. We ﬁrst ﬁtted the pairwise maximum entropy model (PMEM), which
assumes pairwise interaction between ROIs and otherwise pro-
duces a maximally random distribution, which is a Boltzmann
distribution. The PMEM is equivalent to the inverse Ising model,
where the parameters of the Ising model are inferred from data.
Because the model assumes binary data, we binarized the resting-
state fMRI signals obtained from 138 healthy adults. The binarized activity pattern at N( = 264) ROIs41 at time t (t ¼ 1; ¼ ; tmax; tmax ¼ 258) is denoted by S(t) = (S1(t), …, SN(t)) ∈ {−1, +1}N, where Si(t) = 1 and Si(t) = − 1 (i = 1, …, N) indicate that ROI i is active (i.e., the fMRI signal is larger than a threshold) and inactive (i.e., smaller than the threshold), respectively. We ﬁtted the fol-
lowing probability distribution to the population of the 138 participants by maximizing a pseudo likelihood (see “Methods”)24,34:

is thne energy of activioty pattern S, h ¼ fhi : 1 i Ng, and J ¼ Jij : 1 i ≠ j N , where Ji = Jji. Although we refer to E as
the energy, E does not represent the physical energy of a neural
system but is a mathematical construct representing the frequency
with which activity pattern S appears in the given data. Activity
pattern S appears rarely in the data if E corresponding to S is large and vice versa. Parameter hi represents the tendency that Si = 1 is taken because a positive large value of hi implies that Si = 1 as opposed to Si = −1 lowers the energy and hence raises the probability that S with Si = 1 appears. Parameter Jij represents a functional connectivity between ROIs i and j because, if Jij is away from 0, Si, and Sj would be correlated in general. We denote the estimated parameter values by h^ and ^J.
Then, to evaluate how close the current data are to criticality,
we drew phase diagrams by sweeping values of J. In the phase diagrams, we ﬁxed h at h^ following the theoretical convention30,

In (3), μ^ ¼ 1:57 ´ 10À3 and σ^ ¼ 3:57 ´ 10À2 are the mean and

standard deviation of the off-diagonal elements of ^J estimated for

the empirical data. We chose the parametrization given in Eq. (3)

motivated by the past investigation of the archetypical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of spin systems30. The SK

model, a type of Ising model, is deﬁned with parameters Jij (1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ N) that are independently drawn from the Gaussian

distribution with the tunable mean and standard deviation and

has extensively been studied for investigating the so-called spin-

glass phase transition owing to its theoretical tractability. In the

spin-glass phase, the system shows a disorderly frozen pattern of

spins rather than uniform or periodic ones. For each set of Jij values (1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ N) speciﬁed by a (μ, σ) pair, we performed

Monte Carlo simulations and calculated observables (see

“Methods”). In this manner, we generated a phase diagram for

each observable in terms of μ and σ.

Two primary observables (called order parameters in physics

literature) employed in studies of spin systems are the

magnetization, denoted by m, and the spin-glass ordPer parameter, denoted by q. The magnetization is deﬁned by m = 1≤i≤N〈Si〉∕N, where 〈 ⋅ 〉 represents the ensemble average, and quantiﬁes the

mean tendency that Si = 1 as opposed to Si = −1 is taken across

P the
1

ROIs. The i N hSii2=N

spin-glass order parameter and represents the degree of

is deﬁned by q ¼ local magnetization

at individual ROIs. We show m and q as functions of μ and σ in

Fig. 1a, b, respectively. The obtained phase diagrams were

qualitatively the same as those for the SK model of the same

system size, which was given by Eqs. (1) and (2) with each

Jij (=Jji, i ≠ j) being independently drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ (Fig. 1e, f).

The parameter space is composed of three qualitatively different phases30. The paramagnetic phase, characterized by m = 0 and

q = 0 in the limit of N → ∞, represents the situation in which

each Si randomly ﬂips between 1 and −1, yielding no magnetization. The ferromagnetic phase, characterized by

m ≠ 0 and q > 0, represents the situation in which (almost) all

Si’s align in one direction (i.e., Si = 1 or Si = −1). The spin-glass (SG) phase, characterized by m = 0 and q > 0, represents the

situation in which each Si is locally magnetized but not globally aligned to a speciﬁc direction30. Note that the ﬁnite size effect of

our system blurred the boundaries between the different phases.

The current data pooled across the participants lie in

the paramagnetic phase and are close to the boundary to

In theory, the spin-glass where cij = 〈SiSj〉 − mimj,

diverges on the boundary between the paramagnetic and SG phases30. The empirical data yielded a relatively large χSG value in
the phase diagram (Fig. 1c). In contrast, we did not ﬁnd a

(Fig. 1d). Note that the phase diagrams for χSG and χuni resemble those obtained from the SK model (Fig. 1g, h).

Next, we examined where brain activity patterns of each

participant were located in the phase diagrams. We did so by

ﬁnding the μ and σ values corresponding to the χSG and χuni values of each participant (see “Methods”). It should be noted

that χSG and χuni can be calculated for each individual only from the covariance matrix of the data, without estimating the PMEM. The location of each participant in the phase diagram of χSG is shown by the circles in Fig. 1c. The cross section of this phase diagram for μ ¼ μ^ (along the dashed line shown in Fig. 1c) is shown in Fig. 1i. We also projected the χSG values for the individual participants (circles in Fig. 1i) based on the value of σ
estimated for each individual (circles in Fig. 1c). Figure 1i suggests that the empirical data are located in a range of σ that constitutes a peak, further conﬁrming that the brain dynamics of different participants are close to the paramagnetic–SG phase
transition and to different extents. In contrast, the participants were far from the paramagnetic–ferromagnetic phase boundary. This is conﬁrmed in Fig. 1j, which is a cross section of the phase diagram for χuni (along the dashed line shown in Fig. 1d) together with the χuni values for the single participants.
The χSG value for the individual participants was off the largest possible values in the phase diagram (Fig. 1i). To examine this point, we carried out a ﬁnite size scaling on χSG (Fig. 1k). To emulate systems of smaller sizes than N = 264, we selected N0 out of the N ROIs uniformly at random and ﬁtted the PMEM. The estimated parameter values are denoted by h^ and ^J without
confusion. Then, we simulated the equilibrium state of the system by scanning J according to Eq. (3), where we varied σ while ﬁxing μ ¼ μ^. In this manner, we sought to investigate how close the data were to the SG phase transition at each N0 value. As shown in Fig. 1k, the peak value of χSG increased as N0 increased, suggesting that the paramagnetic–SG phase transition is approached as the
system size increases. In addition, the position of the peak, denoted by σpeak, shifted toward the value for the empirical data, σ^, as N increased. By regressing σpeak=σ^ linearly on 1=N0 (inset of Fig. 1k), we estimated σpeak=σ^ ¼ 1:45 ± 0:04 in the limit N0 ! 1.
The performance IQ is associated with the criticality. To test
our hypothesis that criticality of brain dynamics is associated with human ﬂuid intelligence, we examined the correlation between χSG, which encodes the proximity of each participant’s neural dynamics to the paramagnetic–SG phase transition (Fig. 1c, i), and the performance IQ score. The performance IQ score is deﬁned based on tasks that are reﬂective of ﬂuid intelligence42,43. An
enlargement of Fig. 1c is shown in Fig. 2a, where the participants
are shown in different colors depending on whether they have a higher performance IQ score (deﬁned by the score value larger than or equal to the median, 109, n = 68) and a lower score (n =
63). We found that higher-IQ participants tended to be closer to the paramagnetic–SG phase transition than lower-IQ participants, as measured by σ (t129 = 3.17, P < 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.55 in a two-sample t test). The results were qualitatively the same when the outliers were excluded (t127 = 3.52, P < 10−3, d = 0.62). In contrast, the two groups were not different in terms of the distance to the paramagnetic–ferromagnetic phase transition as measured by μ (t129 = 0.77, P = 0.44, d = 0.13 with the outlier included; t127 = 0.85, P = 0.40, d = 0.15 with the outlier excluded).
More systematically, we found a mild positive correlation between χSG and the performance IQ score (r129 = 0.24, PBonferroni = 0.011; also see Fig. 2b). However, the verbal IQ score, which is based on individuals’ verbal knowledge42,43, was not correlated with χSG (r126 = 0.06, Puncorrected = 0.50, Fig. 2c). The correlation between χSG and the performance IQ score was also signiﬁcantly larger than the correlation between χSG and the verbal IQ score (t121 = 2.33, P = 0.021, in the Williams t test for comparing two nonindependent correlations with a variable in common44). These results suggest that the criticality of brain dynamics plays more roles in ﬂuid intelligence than when simply
retrieving verbal knowledge. Note that we partialed out the effects

of the age and gender in this and the following analysis unless we
state otherwise. The correlation between the full IQ score42,43 and χSG was
intermediate between the results for the performance and verbal IQ scores (r130 = 0.19, P = 0.026; also see Fig. 2d), which is natural because the performance and verbal IQ scores are
components of the full IQ score. The association between the spin-glass susceptibility, χSG, and the
different types of IQ scores were robust in the following four ways. First, the exclusion of the two outliers determined by Tukey’s 1.5 criteria45 did not affect the signiﬁcance of the results (χSG vs performance IQ: r127 = 0.27, PBonferroni = 0.005; χSG vs verbal IQ: r124 = 0.13, PBonferroni = 0.27; χSG vs full IQ: r128 = 0.25, P = 0.005). Second, the results were robust against variation on the threshold
value for binarizing the fMRI signal (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Furthermore, changes in the threshold value did not substantially
alter the phase diagrams (Supplementary Fig. 3). Third, the results
were preserved even when the global signal (see Methods) was not subtracted from the fMRI signals (χSG vs performance IQ: r129 = 0.22, PBonferroni = 0.02; χSG vs verbal IQ: r126 = 0.046, Puncorrected = 0.61; χSG vs full IQ: r130 = 0.18, P = 0.043; the outliers were not removed). Fourth, we did not ﬁnd a gender difference in the correlation coefﬁcient between χSG and the IQ scores

(performance IQ: Z = 0.33, P = 0.74 in a Z-test for a pair of correlation coefﬁcients46; verbal IQ: Z = 0.43, P = 0.67; full IQ: Z = 0.17, P = 0.86). In this gender-difference analysis, we partialed
out the effect of the age but not the gender.
Irrelevance of the paramagnetic–ferromagnetic transition. The IQ was not correlated with χuni (performance IQ: r129 = 0.10, Puncorrected = 0.27; verbal IQ: r126 = 0.093, Puncorrected = 0.30; full IQ: r130 = 0.10, P = 0.24, each test including the outliers; performance IQ: r124 = 0.013, Puncorrected = 0.89; verbal IQ: r121 = 0.039, Puncorrected = 0.67; full IQ: r125 = 0.020, P = 0.82, each test excluding the outliers). The speciﬁc heat (denoted by C; see “Methods” for deﬁnition) was only mildly correlated with the performance IQ score (performance IQ: r129 = 0.21, PBonferroni = 0.034; verbal IQ: r126 = −0.0056, Puncorrected = 0.95; full IQ: r130 = 0.13, P = 0.14, each test including the outliers; performance IQ: r125 = 0.16, Puncorrected = 0.08; verbal IQ: r122 = −0.016, Puncorrected = 0.86; full IQ: r126 = 0.10, P = 0.26, each test excluding the outliers). Because χuni and C diverge in the paramagnetic–ferromagnetic phase transition but not in the paramagnetic–SG phase transition30, these negative results lend
another support to the relevance of the SG phase rather than the
ferromagnetic phase to intelligence.

Consistency with the critical slowing down analysis. The pre-
vious literature used various measures of criticality. We measured
for each participant such a measure, i.e., the scaling exponent of autocorrelation47,48. This measure quantiﬁes the critical slowing
down phenomenon, which has been observed in critical states of the brain48. Note that this index quantiﬁes temporal correlation and is
orthogonal to what we have measured. We computed the scaling
exponent for the autocorrelation function of the fMRI signal at each ROI, using the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis47,48. Then, we took the average of the scaling exponent over the N = 264 ROIs for each participant, which is denoted by α. The association between α and the IQ scores was consistent with the results for χSG (α vs performance IQ: r129 = 0.29, PBonferroni = 0.002; α vs verbal IQ: r126 = 0.19, PBonferroni = 0.068; α vs full IQ: r130 = 0.25, P = 0.003). These results were robust against the removal of outliers (α vs performance IQ: r128 = 0.28, PBonferroni = 0.002; α vs verbal IQ: r125 = 0.17, PBonferroni = 0.10; α vs full IQ: r130 = 0.25, P = 0.003).
We then performed a multivariate linear regression of the performance IQ with χSG and α being the independent variable. We found a signiﬁcant regression equation (F2,128 = 8.0, P < 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.11). Both χSG and α were signiﬁcantly correlated with the performance IQ (χSG: β = 0.18, P = 0.039; α: β = 0.24, P = 0.0067). This result implies that the association between χSG and the performance IQ that we have found is not a byproduct of that between α and the performance IQ. The variance inﬂation factor for both independent variables was equal
to 1.07; this value is small enough for justifying the use of the
multivariate regression.

Effects of data length and individual variability. We examined
if the limited data length and between-participant variability in our data inﬂuenced our results. First, we investigated how the estimation of the individual participant’s χSG and χuni depended on the length of her/his fMRI data (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The
results were qualitatively the same as those obtained with all the
data if we used approximately more than two thirds of the data (i.e., number of volumes per participant larger than ≈ 150). The correlation between χSG and the IQ scores and that between χuni and the IQ scores were also preserved with the aforementioned
data length (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). Therefore, our main results based on the χSG and χuni are considered to be reliable in terms of the data length.
Second, as we did in our previous studies21,37, we divided the
participants into two subgroups of the same size and ran some
of the main analyses for the subgroups. We started by comparing the pairwise activity correlation, 〈SiSj〉, for each (i, j) pair between the two subgroups. The 〈SiSj〉 values were strongly correlated between the subgroups and also between the empirical data and
estimated PMEMs for the two subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 5). We further conﬁrmed that the phase diagrams were similar
between the two subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 6). Moreover, we estimated μ~ and σ~ for each participant only using the subgroup of
participants to which the focal participant belongs. The results
were similar to those estimated based on all the participants
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Therefore, we conclude that the estimation of the phase diagrams (Fig. 1a–h) and their derivatives (i.e., μ~ and σ~), which are based on the estimated phase diagrams,

are robust enough against ﬂuctuations in data, such as those caused by a reduced number of participants.
Discussion
We provided empirical support that neural dynamics of humans with higher intellectual ability are closer to critical. The present results are consistent with the standing claim of the “critical brain hypothesis” and “edge-of-chaos computation”, which jointly dictate that the brain is maximizing its computational performance by poising its dynamics close to the criticality, particularly the criticality involving a chaotic regime.
Here we presented an explicit, albeit only moderate, correlation between the IQ scores and the distance from criticality at an individual’s level. Human intelligence has been shown to be associated with genetic factors, brain size, the volume of speciﬁc brain regions49, and the structure of brain networks26,49. The present results derived from dynamic fMRI signals provide an orthogonal account of human intelligence as compared with these previous studies and are consistent with the view that cognition is a dynamical process linked to neural dynamics18,19.
A previous study showed that sleep deprivation pulls the brain dynamics away from the criticality50. This result is consistent with ours because sleep deprivation generally compromises one’s cognitive and intellectual functions51.
Previous studies showed that the functional connectivity between particular pairs of ROIs or between subsystems of the brain in the resting state was correlated with intellectual ability49,52. These previous results are consistent with ours in the sense that the SG susceptibility can be regarded as the square sum of a type of functional connectivity over the pairs of ROIs and the intellectual score was positively correlated with the SG susceptibility in our analysis. In contrast to these previous studies, which looked at individual connectivity between two regions or subnetworks, we considered N = 264 ROIs scattered over the brain41 as a single functional network. We took this approach for two reasons. First, intelligence is considered to depend on large-scale brain networks26,52–54. Second, phase diagram analysis ideally requires a thermodynamic limit, i.e., inﬁnitely many ROIs. One strategy to further approach the thermodynamic limit is to use a single voxel acquired by MRI as a node, signiﬁcantly scaling up N. In this case, spatial correlation among ROIs, which we have ignored in the present study, would be prominent. Because the spatial dimensionality affects the phase diagrams even qualitatively30, this case may require two- or three-dimensional SG models. We leave this as a future problem. The literature also suggest that speciﬁc brain systems such as the fronto-parietal network55 and the default-mode network56 predict intelligence of humans. Running the same analysis for these and other brain systems to seek speciﬁcity of the results warrants future work. Because the present method requires hundreds of ROIs, we may beneﬁt from considering voxel-wise networks of a speciﬁc brain system that allow many ROIs for particular brain systems.
In our previous paper, we posed the limited accuracy of ﬁtting the PMEM to fMRI data when N is large38. The argument was based on the probability that each of the 2N possible activity patterns appears compared between the empirical data and the estimated PMEM. In the present manuscript, we have not used this accuracy measure, because it cannot be calculated when N is large. Instead, we validated the model by conﬁrming that the difference between the empirical data and estimated PMEM in terms of the signal average, 〈Si〉, and the pairwise correlation, 〈SiSj〉, is small (Supplementary Fig. 8). This approach is based on the assumption that the average and second order correlation of signals explain most of the information contained in the given data, which has been conﬁrmed for smaller N in previous studies

using fMRI data21,24,37,38. Although only comparing 〈Si〉 and 〈SiSj〉 between the data and model is a weaker notion of accuracy of ﬁt than using the accuracy measure38, the former approach has widely been accepted, explicitly or implicitly, in the literature57,58.
However, we point out that how to justify the use of PMEMs
when N is large remains an open issue.
There are various types of criticality, corresponding to different
types of phase transitions. Within the framework of the Ising
model, we showed that human fMRI data were in the para-
magnetic phase and were close to the boundary with the SG phase
but not to the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase. Furthermore, high ﬂuid intelligence was associated with the proximity to
the boundary between the paramagnetic and SG phases. In the-
ory, the SG phase yields chaotic dynamics in spin systems including the SK model31–33, whereas the ferromagnetic phase is obviously non-chaotic. Therefore, although the deﬁnition of the
chaos in the SG phase is different from that observed in cellular automata15 and recurrent neural networks16,17, our results are
consistent with the idea of enhanced computational performance
at the edge of chaos.
The previous accounts of the critical brain or critical neural
circuits are mostly concerned with phase transitions different from the paramagnetic–SG phase transition or its analogs.
Examples include phase transitions between quiescent (i.e., sub-
critical) and active (i.e., supercritical) phases as an excitability control parameter changes11,12,59–61, between ordered and chaotic phases as connectivity parameters change17, between a
low-activity monostable state and a high-activity multistable state62, and the divergence of heat capacity5,6,35,36. Note that, in
the theory of the Ising models, the heat capacity diverges on the
boundary between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases,
whereas it increases without diverging on the boundary between the paramagnetic and SG phases30. Most of these previous results
based on the Ising model related neural dynamics to the paramagnetic–ferromagnetic phase transition rather than the paramagnetic–SG transition. Roughly speaking, paramagnetic
and ferromagnetic phases correspond to active and quiescent
phases, respectively. Computational studies also support the ferromagnetism13,63,64. In contrast, we provided a signature of the paramagnetic–SG phase transition, not the paramagnetic-
ferromagnetic transition. Fraiman et al. reported that the Ising model at the paramagnetic–ferromagnetic phase transition explains properties of functional networks based on fMRI data63.
They used a two-dimensional Ising model with a uniform
strength of interaction between pairs of nodes that are adjacent on a square lattice (and Jij = 0 for the rest of pairs). Another study that suggested the paramagnetic–ferromagnetic phase transition for fMRI signals also assumed a uniform Jij64. In contrast, we did not constrain the Jij values and instead inferred the Jij values (i.e., structure of functional network) using the PMEM. Because these previous studies63,64 did not assume heterogeneity in Jij as we did, their results do not contradict ours. In fact, the assumption of a uniform Jij corresponds to setting σ = 0 in our phase diagrams. If one varies μ under the condition σ = 0, the only possible phase transition is the paramagnetic–ferromagnetic transition (Fig. 1a–d). However, that phase transition point, which is derived under the condition σ = 0, is far from the location of the empirical data when σ is allowed to deviate from 0 (crosses in Fig. 1a–d). Therefore, allowing heterogeneity in Jij may be key to further clarifying the nature of critical neural dynamics.
We showed that neural dynamics for each participant were
close to but substantially off the criticality separating the paramagnetic and SG phases. Other studies using the PMEM65 and other models66 also support off-critical as opposed to critical
neural dynamics in the brain. A study applying the PMEM to local ﬁeld potentials suggested that such off-critical dynamics

may potentially have functional advantages because the offcritical situation would prevent the dynamics to get past the phase boundary to enter the other phase under the presence of noise66. The other phase may correspond to pathological neural dynamics such as epilepsy. The off-critical neural dynamics that we found for our participants, regardless of their IQ scores, may beneﬁt from the same functional advantage.
Applying the current analysis pipeline to various neuroimaging and electrophysiological data in different contexts, from health to disease, and during rest and tasks, to evaluate the relevance of the different types of phase transitions warrants future work. For example, as a disease progresses, the brain dynamics may be gradually altered to transit from one phase to another, or to approach or repel from a phase transition curve. In fact, the method is applicable to general multivariate time series. Deployment of the present method to other biological and nonbiological data may also be productive.
One could classify the data from participants with high and low IQ scores using a simple multivariate Gaussian decoder67. Such a decoder would assume as input the mean and covariance of the fMRI data for each participant or its random samples having the same mean and covariance. In fact, multivariate Gaussian distributions having the same covariance structure as the empirical data yielded similar results (Supplementary Fig. 9). Because our PMEM also assumed the same input but was not optimized for classifying the participants, an optimized Gaussian decoder will probably be more efﬁcient than our PMEM in explaining the IQ scores of the participants. This approach is conceptually much simpler than the present one, which employ the PMEM and its phase diagrams. However, the aim of the present study was to ﬁnd empirical support of the critical brain hypothesis by relating the fMRI data to the phase diagrams of an archetypal spin system rather than to efﬁciently classify participants.
We found that the SG susceptibility was positively, although not strongly, correlated with individual differences in the performance IQ score but not in the verbal IQ score. The verbal IQ reﬂects individuals’ knowledge about verbal concepts and crystalized intelligence43; crystalized intelligence refers to one’s cognitive functioning associated with previously acquired knowledge and skills. In contrast, the performance IQ reﬂects ﬂuid intelligence, which refers to active or effortful problem solving and maintenance of information39. Our results imply that the critical brain dynamics may be particularly useful for active and ﬂexible cognitive functions.

respectively. It should be noted that this updating rule avoids the calculation of 〈Si〉 and 〈SiSj〉 with the original spin system, Eqs. (1) and (2), which is computationally formidable with N = 264. As tmax ! 1, the estimator obtained by the PL maximization approaches the exact maximum likelihood estimator70. In fact, the Ising model with the estimated parameter values h ¼ h^ and J ¼ ^J produced the mean and correlation of spins in the empirical data with a sufﬁciently high
accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 8).
We previously provided MATLAB code for estimating the Ising model from data by PL maximization38. The code is publicly available on GitHub repository

Methods
Participants. One-hundred thirty eight (n = 138) healthy and right-handed adult participants (54 females and 84 males) in the Nathan Kline Institute’s (NKI) Rockland phase I Sample68 were analyzed. The data collection was approved by the institutional review board of the Nathan Kline Institute (no. 226781). Written informed consent was obtained for all the participants. Although the data set contains a wide range of the age (18–85 yo), the present results were not an age effect because the IQ values are standardized for age42 and because we have partialed out the effect of age (and the gender) in the present analysis. Participants’ IQ scores were derived from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence42. We used the full scale IQ (full IQ for short), performance IQ, and verbal IQ.
Preprocessing. We used the same MRI data and the same preprocessing pipeline as our previous study’s69, except that we used resting-state fMRI signals from 264 ROIs, whose coordinates were derived in the previous literature41. In short, we submitted the resting-state fMRI data in the NKI Rockland phase I Sample with TR = 2500 ms and for 10 min 55 s for each participant to our preprocessing pipeline in FSL and applied band-pass temporal ﬁltering (0.01–0.1 Hz).
The obtained fMRI signals xi(t) (i ¼ 1; ¼ ; N; t ¼ 1; ¼ ; tmax, where tmax ¼ 258) were transformed into their z-values using zi(t) = (xi(t) − μ(x(t)))∕σ(x (t)), where μ(x(t)) and σ(x(t)) represent the average and standard deviation of xi(t) over the N ROIs, respectively. Note that μ(x(t)) is the global signal. When we tested the robustness of the results by not removing the global signal, we set zi(t) = xi(t).

Monte Carlo simulation. We used the Metropolis method71 to calculate the observables of the Ising model estimated from the empirical data and the SK model. In each time step, a spin Si was chosen uniformly at random for being updated. The selected spin was ﬂipped with probability minfeÀΔE; 1g, where ΔE = E(Sﬂipped) − E(S), S is the current spin conﬁguration, and Sﬂipped is the spin conﬁguration after Si is ﬂipped. The initial condition was given by Si = 1 with probability 1/2 (and hence Si = −1 with probability 1/2), independently for different i’s. We recorded the spin conﬁguration S every N time steps.
For the empirical data, we discarded the ﬁrst 106 × N time steps as transient and then recorded 107 samples of S in total. Based on the 107 samples, we calculated the averages of the observables (i.e., ∣m∣, q, χSG, χuni, and C). For drawing the phase diagrams with the N = 264 ROIs, we further averaged each observable over ten independent simulations starting from different initial spin conﬁgurations. In Fig. 1k, we averaged the χSG value over 40 combinations of N0 ROIs out of the 264 ROIs as well as over 107 samples and ten initial conditions.
For the phase diagram for the SK model, we discarded the ﬁrst 104 × N time steps as transient and then collected 5 × 104 samples of S from each of 103 realizations of J. We drew the phase diagrams on the basis of the 5 × 104 × 103 = 5 × 107 samples.
Estimation of μ and σ for single participants. The estimation of the empirical interaction matrix, ^J, requires a large amount of data, or practically, concatenation of fMRI data across different participants. Therefore, one cannot directly compute the mean and standard deviation of ^J (i.e., μ and σ) for each participant. Given this constraint, we estimated μ and σ for each participant (denoted by μ~ and σ~) using

the χSG and χuni values for the participant (denoted by ~χSG and ~χuni) as follows (Supplementary Fig. 10).
First, we examined the phase diagrams in terms of χSG and χuni generated for the collection of all participants (Fig. 1c, d). Speciﬁcally, we calculated χSG(μ, σ) and χuni(μ, σ) values at μ = μk (k = 1, …, 25), where μ1 = −0.002, μ2 = −0.0015, …, μ25 = 0.01, and σ = σℓ (ℓ = 1, …, 21), where σ1 = 0, σ2 = 0.0075, …, σ21 = 0.15.
Second, at each μk(k = 1, …, 25), we computed the value of σk satisfying χSGðμk; σkÞ ¼ ~χSG (Supplementary Fig. 10a, c) using a linear interpolation of χSG(μk, σℓ) (ℓ = 1, …, 21), i.e., σk ¼ ασ‘0 þ ð1 À αÞσ‘0þ1, where ‘0 (1 ‘0 21) is the integer satisfying χSGðμk; σ‘0 Þ ~χSG < χSGðμk; σ‘0þ1Þ, and α ¼ ½χSGðμk; σ‘0þ1ÞÀ ~χSG=½χSGðμk; σ‘0þ1Þ À χSGðμk; σ‘0 Þ. Because χSG(μk, σℓ) increases with ℓ in the paramagnetic phase, the ‘0 value is uniquely determined for each k, if it exists. In this manner, we obtained a piecewise linear curve whose knots were (μk; σk) (k = 1, …, 25). On this curve, χSG(μ, σ) is approximately equal to ~χSG (Supplementary Fig. 10e, g). It should be noted that we have assumed that ð~μ; σ~Þ to be estimated is near ð^μ; σ^Þ computed for the entire population (represented by the cross in Fig. 1a–d). More precisely, we are searching ðμ~; σ~Þ in the vicinity of the
paramagnetic–SG phase boundary on the paramagnetic side. This assumption is
supported by the empirical values of m and q for individual participants, i.e., m = −8.0 × 10−3 ± 7.8 × 10−3 (mean ± SD) and q = 3.4 × 10−3 ± 0.4 × 10−3.
Third, we calculated a piecewise linear curve on which χuni(μ, σ) was approximately equal to ~χuni (Supplementary Fig. 10f, g). To this end, we applied the same algorithm as the one used in the previous step but by ﬁxing σℓ (Supplementary Fig. 10b) and ﬁnding μ‘ (Supplementary Fig. 10d), exploiting the fact that χuni(μk, σℓ) monotonically increases with μ in the paramagnetic phase.
Finally, we computed (~μ, σ~) for the individual as the intersection of the two
piecewise linear curves (Supplementary Fig. 10g).

where T is the temperature. We set T = 1 because we implicitly did so in Eqs. (1)
and (2). To compute C for each participant, we ﬁrst drew a phase diagram for C in terms
of μ and σ for the entire population (Supplementary Fig. 11a). The obtained phase
diagram was similar to that for the SK model (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Then, we
determined the C value for each participant as the point in the phase diagram corresponding to the (μ, σ) for the participant. Because the phase diagram for C is drawn for discrete values of μ and σ, we applied the standard bilinear interpolation to determine the C value corresponding to a given (μ, σ).
