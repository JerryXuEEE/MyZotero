It addresses a broad range of aspects, from physiology to nonlinear dynamical approaches to understanding neural computation, and from the simulation of brain circuits to the development of engineering devices and platforms for neuromorphic computation. Written by leading experts in such diverse fields as neuroscience, physics, psychology, neural engineering, cognitive science and applied mathematics, the book reflects the remarkable advances that have been made in the field of computational neuroscience, an emerging discipline devoted to the study of brain functions in terms of the information-processing properties of the structures forming the nervous system. The contents build on the workshop “Nonlinear Dynamics in Computational Neuroscience: from Physics and Biology to ICT,” which was held in Torino, Italy in September 2015. \nBack to top \nKeywords \n \n    Neuromorphic Systems \n    Translational Neuroscience \n    Biomedical Signals \n    CMOS Transistors \n    Memristor \n    Neuronal Complexity \n    Neurobiosensors \n    Spiking Networks \n    Computational Neuroscience  \n \nBack to top \nEditors and Affiliations \n \n    Dipartimento di Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni (DET), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy \n \n    Fernando Corinto \n    Laboratoire de Physique Théorique et Modélisation, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France \n \n    Alessandro Torcini \n \nBack to top \nAbout the editors \nFernando Corinto is professor of Circuit Theory at Politecnico di Torino, Italy.
