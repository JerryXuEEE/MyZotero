Kreuzer, MD*; Jonathan Downar, MD†‡§¶; Dirk de Ridder, MD**††; Jens Schwarzbach, PhD*; Martin Schecklmann, PhD*; Berthold Langguth, MD*\n\nBackground: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become increasingly popular during the last decades mainly driven by the antidepressant effects of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation with “butterﬂy” coils. Only recently, alternative targets such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) have been brought into focus and innovative coil designs such as the angled geometry of the double cone coil (DCC) have raised hope to reach even deeper located targets.\nObjective: To provide a systematic and comprehensive review on the application of rTMS stimulation of the dmPFC using the DCC in neuropathological and healthy samples. Methods: We systematically searched the MEDLINE® database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). Due to the heterogeneous naming of DCC stimulation over the dmPFC a variety of search terms was applied resulting in a numeral quantity of 340 hits.\nResults: DCC stimulation over the dmPFC has been proven to be safe and feasible in various neuropsychiatric disorders and in healthy subjects. Clinical results are encouraging, but have to be considered as preliminary as data from sham-controlled clinical trials and knowledge about the neurobiological underpinnings are still scarce.\nConclusion: DCC stimulation over the dmPFC represents a promising approach in the fast evolving noninvasive brain stimulation techniques aiming at the functional modulation of brain areas vitally involved in affect, sensory autonomic, cognitive, and salience regulation. This may hold potential for both neuroscientiﬁc research and clinical applications in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.\nKeywords: ACDC anterior cingulate cortex dm-PFC dorsomedial prefrontal cortex double cone coil repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation\nConﬂict of Interest: The authors reported no conﬂict of interest.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an emerging brain\nstimulation technique that has become increasingly popular thanks to its focal, noninvasive and clinically well-tolerated characteristics (1). A number of TMS techniques are nowadays used for routine diagnostic application (2) and over the last decade repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has received increasing attention as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of different neuropsychiatric conditions (for a comprehensive overview about the use of rTMS for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders see (3)). rTMS is regarded a safe intervention, with limited and transient side effects in most cases (4), and has proven suitable for both in- and out-patient treatment settings (5).\nLimitations and Challenges Although, an extensive literature supports the efﬁcacy of rTMS\nin its most common application treating major depression (1,6,7), outcomes remain quite variable across individuals, and many studies have suggested at best moderate efﬁcacy in clinical routine applications (3). Moreover, rTMS effects depend on\n\nstimulation related (e.g., coil form and position, intensity, frequency, number of stimuli, stimulation pattern) and patient related (e.g., age, medication, activities before, and during stimulation) factors and a complex interaction between them.\nAddress correspondence to: Peter M.

Focality is improved with a “ﬁgure-of-eight” coil (F8c) (8), reducing the stimulation zone to a few square centimeters (9) and making it sensitive to coil handle orientation. However, the penetration depth of “conventional” TMS coils such as the ﬁgure-of-8-coil in brain tissue is limited to superﬁcial cortical areas (10) leading to a variety of newly developed innovative coil types. One of these, the “double cone” angulated coil (DCC) consists of two large circular coils forming an obtuse angle. To our knowledge, this type of coil was ﬁrst introduced by Magstim in the year 1999/2000; Magventure presented a similar coil type certiﬁed for medical use in 2004. At the expense of less focality, this type of coil is useful for reaching deeper targets such as the representation of the lower limbs in the primary motor cortex (M1) located within the interhemispheric ﬁssure (11) allowing for the modulation of deeper located brain structures of interest. In particular, such coils may enable stimulation of limbic cortical regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (12). It should not be overlooked, that determined by the principles of physics existent TMS coils are limited in their precision of spatial targeting (focality) especially when aiming to reach deeper located brain structures. A certain trade-off between depth, focality and the energy required by the coil is inherent to the system (13).\nThe role of the ACC The ACC consists of four different subregions within Brodmann\nareas 24 and 25 (14) and is involved in different emotional, cognitive, sensory, and autonomic functions (15,16). In a recent publication (17) on the functional role of the ACC in psychiatric disorders, it was proposed that the rostral ACC is involved in uncertainty processing (18–21), the dorsal ACC (dACC) in an urge for action (22), obtaining more information, the pregenual ACC (pgACC) in suppressing further input (17) and hedonia (23), and the subgenual ACC (sgACC) in autonomic processing (24). The sgACC plays a major role in the pathophysiology of depression (25,26). Ventral and dorsal subregions exist, with hyperactivity in ventral/subgenual ACC regions and hypoactivity of dorsal ACC regions commonly reported in major depression and several other disorders (25,26). Structural neuroimaging studies demonstrate volume reduction in ventral ACC in depressed patients (27), whereas functional neuroimaging studies have shown elevated resting-stateactivity in the ventral ACC in depressed patients (28,29) and during experimental induction of sadness in healthy subjects (29). Importantly, both ventral and dorsal ACC activity has been demonstrated to represent a potential predictor of therapeutic response in unipolar depression (30) and have been closely linked to the therapeutic effects of TMS in depression (31–34).\nRecently, increasing evidence has emerged to link the dorsal ACC in particular to the pathophysiology of a wide range of mental and neurological disorders. A recent meta-analysis based on 193 voxel-based-morphometry (VBM) studies looked for a common neuronal substrate across multiple psychiatric disorders (35). This study revealed that three regions, the left and right anterior insula and the dorsal ACC, showed signiﬁcant gray matter loss\n\nTable 1.

These three regions constitute the anterior cingulo-insular network, which has been designated as the “salience network” (36).\nDeﬁciencies in self-regulation of emotions, thoughts, and behaviors are a core feature of psychiatric illness, and are also consistent with what is known about the functions of the dACC and anterior insula (37). The dACC stands midway along a hierarchy of medial prefrontal regions (ranging from the medial frontopolar cortex anteriorly, to supplementary motor area posteriorly) that guide goal selection, thought selection, and action selection based on internal drives, as opposed to external cues (38,39).\nSuch observations ﬁt well with the notion that the ACC may contribute to individual differences in personality traits related to reward sensitivity and persistence. These traits in turn represent a neurocognitive construct, which, according to the Research Domain Criteria framework, express dimensionally across the population and give rise to multiple mental disorders, when expressed in a maladaptive way (40). Taken together these data suggest that the dorsal ACC is critically involved in the neurocognitive constructs of “cognitive control,” and speciﬁcally the subconstruct of “response selection,” and that deﬁciencies in these functions represent a common element across psychiatric disorders, notwithstanding their differences in other domains (37).\nTargeting the dorsal ACC may therefore be a fruitful therapeutic approach across a variety of diagnostic entities, via a mechanism of action involving enhancements of cognitive control, impulse control, and affective stability.\nObjective of This Review Repetitive TMS using a double cone coil (DCC) has been shown\nto modulate the neural activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) by placing the coil over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) (12). This stimulation procedure has been claimed as ACDCstimulation (anterior-cingulate stimulation by DCC rTMS) (41). Unfortunately, no common “labeling” of this kind of stimulation has been consistently carried out impeding a detailed and quick overview of the available literature on the topic. This situation led to the authors’ decision to integrate various targets when supposedly affecting the ACC by DCC rTMS (Table 1). ACDC-rTMS and dmPFC-DCC rTMS are regarded as synonyms in the context of this manuscript.\n\n2\n\nwww.neuromodulationjournal.com\n\n© 2018 International Neuromodulation Society\n\nNeuromodulation 2018; ••: ••–••\n\nwww.neuromodulationjournal.com\n\nTable 2.

It was further shown that multiple sessions of AC/DC TMS generate a higher suppression effect in comparison to a single session of AC/DC TMS and that more patients responded to repeated sessions of 1 Hz stimulation in comparison to a single session.\n\nDORSOMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX DCC rTMS\n\nNeuromodulation 2018; ••: ••–••\n\n© 2018 International Neuromodulation Society\n\nwww.neuromodulationjournal.com\n\n6\n\nTable 2.

As a basis, the present manuscript aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive overview on the current knowledge about dmPFC-DCC-rTMS in the available clinical and neuroscientiﬁc literature to date.\n\nMETHODS\nWe systematically searched the MEDLINE® database (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/; accession date April 3, 2018). Due to the heterogeneous naming of dmPFC-DCC-stimulation, we applied a variety of search terms listed in detail in Table 1. We also searched the reference lists of articles identiﬁed in this search strategy and selected relevant articles. We excluded articles using the H-coil even if it shares some similarities with the double-cone coil also aiming at a stimulation of deeper brain areas. However, the H-coil clearly differs from the DCC with respect to the geometry of the produced magnetic ﬁeld allowing a broader and even deeper (but less focal) stimulation of brain areas.\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 30 of the initially identiﬁed 340 hits (Table 1) were ﬁtting to the issue of the review. Remarkably, these manuscripts cover a broad range of applications in both healthy volunteers and members of clinical populations. We provide a comprehensive overview of the reviewed manuscripts, the indication for stimulation, the number and characteristics of stimulated individuals, the presence and type of a sham control condition, the applied stimulation parameters, equipment, the exact target and the main outcomes in Table 2.\n\nNeuroscientiﬁc and Preclinical Studies In 2004, Hayward and colleagues demonstrated that the Stroop\ninterference effect can be abolished through rTMS over the anterior cingulate (42). The same group then used H2 (15)O PET to explore the physiological effects of double-cone coil TMS over the medial frontal cortex (12) when rTMS was administered at 10 Hz by means of a Magstim DCC located 1.5 cm anterior to 1/3 of the distance from the nasion to the inion. SPM99 analyses, using the ACC as a region of interest, revealed clusters of increased regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) during medial frontal TMS in Brodmann area (BA) 24 and reduced rCBF in more ventral ACC (12). A wholebrain analysis revealed striking rCBF changes distal to the ACC (12).\nThe inhibition of the posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pMPFC) by 1 Hz dmPFC stimulation and its effects on theory of mind (TOM) reasoning has been investigated in 17 healthy students. The discrepancy in reaction times between judging another’s and one’s own belief was decreased by one single session of 2000 pulses of dmPFC-DCC–stimulation at 1 Hz (43). This result was interpreted as support for pMPFC’s causal role in establishing perspective differences.\nMoore et al. reported increasing generosity after stimulating the prefrontal cortex with continuous theta burst stimulation applying DCC TMS in healthy subjects playing an unregulated dictator game (44). Colin Holbrook reported the modulation of group\n\n© 2018 International Neuromodulation Society\n\nNeuromodulation 2018; ••: ••–••\n\nDORSOMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX DCC rTMS\n\nprejudice and religious beliefs by dmPFC-DCC–stimulation providing a proof-of-concept that adherence to high-level abstract beliefs can be experimentally modulated by dmPFC rTMS (45).\nKlucharev and colleagues demonstrated in 2011 that the transient down-regulation of the posterior medial frontal cortex by theta-burst TMS reduces social conformity thus providing the ﬁrst interventional evidence of the critical role of the dmPFC in social inﬂuence on human behavior (46).\nAnother study was conducted focusing on experimental pain was published by D’Agata and colleagues in 2015 (47). Superﬁcial electrical stimulation was used to induce continuous pain on the dominant hand. TMS (ﬁve single pulses at increasing intensities) was applied on ﬁve equidistant points (one per session) over the medial line of the scalp in 13 healthy volunteers using a doublecone coil. TMS stimulation temporarily decreased the pain ratings, and pain adaptation was suppressed when applying the TMS over the FCz site on the scalp. No effect was found for distress ratings (47).\nCho et al. (48) examined the effects of mPFC stimulation by DCC on discounting of delayed rewards applying one session of 10 HzrTMS of the mPFC and 1 session of vertex stimulation (control condition) in 1 day (15 10-pulse trains of 1-sec duration at 10 Hz). Thereafter, a subgroup of the participants were involved in a PET study using [11C]-(þ)-PHNO for striatal dopamine measurement. Modulation of the mPFC excitability inﬂuenced delayed rewards and interfered with synaptic dopamine level in the striatum (48).\nTzabazis and colleagues conducted a technically elaborate study on shaped magnetic ﬁeld pulses by multicoil rTMS consisting of up to four simultaneously activated coils tailoring the magnetic ﬁeld towards maximal effect on the dACC in healthy controls as well as patients suffering from ﬁbromyalgia (49) substantially differing from the technical setup of all studies on dmPFC-DCC-rTMS reported above. Results showed that a single 30 min session using one of three tested rTMS coil conﬁgurations operated at 1 Hz produced robust reductions in evoked pain in volunteers. In ﬁbromyalgia patients, 20 rTMS sessions also produced a signiﬁcant pain inhibition, but only when operated at 10 Hz. This degree of pain control was maintained for at least 4 weeks after the ﬁnal session (49).\nClinical Studies One of the very ﬁrst clinical applications of dmPFC-DCC-rTMS\nwas reported by de Ridder et al. in 2011 (50) treating a patient with alcohol craving. One rTMS treatment was successful, another resulted in a relapse; however, fMRI and resting-state EEG were performed and demonstrated, that craving related EEG beta activity and connectivity between the dACC and posterior cingulate disappeared after successful dmPFC-DCC-rTMS (50). Another case report was published by the same group reporting clinical improvement of a patient with medication-resistant chronic depression after 10 sessions of 10 Hz dmPFC-DCC-stimulation that was accompanied by resting-state EEG changes in the dorsal and subgenual ACC (51).\nFurther, Vanneste published a manuscript in which the effects of single sessions of dmPFC-DCC-stimulation at different frequencies on tinnitus were reported. In a ﬁrst study in 78 tinnitus patients was demonstrated that 1 and 3 Hz dmPFC-DCC-rTMS were able to improve both tinnitus intensity and distress, whereas 5 Hz stimulation equaled sham and 20 Hz was signiﬁcantly worse than sham (52). In a second study patients received either single sessions of 1 Hz dmPFC-DCC-rTMS or repeated treatments (53):\n\nsingle sessions as well as multiple sessions suppressed tinnitus distress and intensity transiently with a higher suppression effect and enhanced responder rates when applying multiple sessions (53). De Ridder also proposed dmPFC-DCC-stimulation for predicting clinical effects of ACC-implants: In two patients with chronic tinnitus, who had a transient response after dmPFC-DCC-stimulation, long lasting tinnitus suppression could be achieved by implantation of epidural electrodes over the ACC (54).\nA case report by Downar et al. in 2012 laid the groundwork for later studies on dmPFC stimulation in binge-purge-behaviors. In a woman suffering from refractory bulimia nervosa and receiving high-dose dmPFC stimulation for the treatment of her comorbid depression an unanticipated rapid remission of her bulimia nervosa was observed (55).\nIn a subsequent study (56), the effects of 20–30 sessions of bilateral 10 Hz dmPFC-rTMS in treatment-resistant patients suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were investigated. Fifty percent of the treated patients met response criteria and reductions in fronto-striatal hyperconnectivity were associated with treatment response to dmPFC-rTMS (56). The same research group reported results of an open-label-study on patients with treatment-resistant major depression. In this study, patients were treated by neuronavigated dmPFC stimulation and showed significant improvements on two common clinical scales for depression (HAMD-17 and BDI-II) after 20 sessions (57). A further study dealt with the treatment of 28 patients suffering from refractory anorexia nervosa, binge-purge subtype or bulimia nervosa. Patients were treated by 10 Hz dmPFC-rTMS stimulation in 20–30 sessions and 16 out of 28 patients reported a reduction of bingepurge-frequency by at least 50% (58).\nThe same group contributed several more manuscripts: Schulze et al. (59) had a close look on cognitive safety of dmPFC stimulation in major depression. In 21 patients who underwent 20 rTMS sessions no deterioration in cognitive performance was detected in any measures. However, a signiﬁcant improvement on Stroop Inhibition/Switching and Trails B testing was noted independently from the improvement of depressive symptoms (59). In 2018, Schulze et al. published a manuscript reporting results of an open-label study for once- vs. twice-daily dorsomedial prefrontal rTMS in major depression involving 130 patients retrospectively (60). Coil positioning followed a heuristic model validated against MRI-guidance in 232 patients priorily (61). Overall, treatment was well tolerated, no treatment-limiting adverse events occurred in any of the 130 participants. No signiﬁcant difference in rates of response and BDI-score-changes were detected. Salomons (62) reported a signiﬁcant decrease of mean HAMD-17 score from 21.3 (Æ6.7) at baseline to 12.0 (Æ8.2) after 4 weeks of dmPFC stimulation in depressive patients. Successful treatment was associated with increased dmPFC-thalamic connectivity and decreased subgenual cingulate cortex-caudate connectivity (62). Bakker et al. (63) did a retrospective chart review on safety, tolerability, effectiveness, and outcome predictors for 10 Hz vs. intermittent theta-burst stimulation of the dmPFC in medication-resistant depressive patients (10 Hz, n = 98; iTBS, n = 87) and reported no seizures or serious adverse events in both groups. The effectiveness of 6 min iTBS and 30 min 10 Hz protocols appeared comparable with outcomes not differing signiﬁcantly between groups after 20–30 TMS sessions (Response/ remission rates: Beck Depression Inventory-II: 10 Hz, 40.6%/29.2%; iTBS, 43.0%/31.0%. 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression: 10 Hz, 50.6%/38.5%; iTBS, 48.5%/27.9%). Downar et al. published a manuscript on the possibility to distinguish nonresponders from responders to dmPFC stimulation in major depression both\n\n11\n\nwww.neuromodulationjournal.com\n\n© 2018 International Neuromodulation Society\n\nNeuromodulation 2018; ••: ••–••\n\nKREUZER ET AL.\n\nclinically and neurobiologically by anhedonia and reward-circuit connectivity, respectively (64). Clinically, they reported a strongly bimodal distribution of clinical effects after 20 sessions of 6000 stimuli of dmPFC-DCC-stimulation at 10 Hz with a lateral coil orientation facilitating a preferential hemispheric stimulation of the ACC (subsequent stimulation of left and right hemisphere with 3000 stimuli each): patients were either showing minimal or marked improvement, nonresponders showed lower connectivity through a reward pathway comprising the ventral tegmental area, striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex at baseline (64). In a further large study, it has been shown that clustering of patients based on resting state fMRI measurements reveals neurophysiologically distinct subtypes of depression which differ in their response to both 10 Hz rTMS and iTBS of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (65). fMRI based connectivity features predicted individual differences in the rTMS responsiveness with 78.3% accuracy (65).\nModirrousta et al. published two manuscripts dealing with dmPFC-DCC-stimulation of patients suffering from OCD in 2015: the ﬁrst (Ref. 66 in Table 2) reported results of an open-label study in ten OCD patients. All patients showed an improvement of their OCD symptoms after ten sessions of 1 Hz rTMS (1200 pulses) and remained stable during the 1 month follow-up period (66). The second study (Ref. 67, Table 2) focused on the improvement of impaired trial-by-trial adjustment of cognitive control in the same ten patients “after deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation” by DCC rTMS targeting the anterior cingulate (BA 24 and 32) with 1200 pulses/session of 1 Hz stimulation (66). OCD patients in this experiment showed abnormally slow response times (RTs) following correct responses. Patients symptoms and slowed RTs following correct responses improved after ten sessions of 1 Hz rTMS, 1200 pulses/session (67).\nIn a randomized controlled study add-on treatment of depression by dmPFC-DCC-stimulation at 10 Hz has been compared to sham and conventional stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using a ﬁgure-of-eight coil (68). In this study, there was a signiﬁcant group x time interaction effect regarding the HAMD-21-score; post hoc t-tests revealed a signiﬁcant superior effect for dmPFC-DCC vs. DLPFC-F8c stimulation at week 3/end of treatment. In a second study from this group a combined stimulation paradigm comprising dmPFC-DCCstimulation was applied in patients with chronic tinnitus which failed to show superiority of ACDC-stimulation and low-frequency stimulation of the temporoparietal junction area (TPJ). In comparison to an active TMS-control-condition consisting of 10 Hzstimulation of the left DLPFC followed by 1 Hz-stimulation of the TPJ (69) lacking a sham-controlled study arm.\nNaro and colleagues conducted a study on pain processing detection in chronic disorders of consciousness (DOC) and enrolled ten healthy controls, ten MCS (minimally conscious state) patients, and ten UWS patients (unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). In all healthy controls and MCS patients and in two of the UWS subjects, 600 stimuli of 1 Hz-rTMS increased γ-band oscillatory activity and reduced the amplitude of cortical nociceptive potentials evoked by transcutaneous electric sinusoidal stimuli (EEP) (70).\nHara and colleagues reported two cases of patients with severe brain injury treated with TMS (Cool-DB80-coil), the ﬁrst one targeting the ACC as single-photon emission computed tomography excaminations had shown reduced perfusion at this location. The patient received 12 sessions of 10-Hz TMS (total of 2400 pulses per day and session) resulting in an improvement of Mini-MentalState Scores remaining stable over the 3-month follow-up period.\n\nHowever, no change in Wechsler Memory Scale and Rivermeda Behvioural Memory Test was observed (71).\nSasaki and colleagues presented another manuscript examining the efﬁcacy of anterior-cingulate-cortex TMS utilizing a Cool-DB80 coil in 13 patients with chronic stroke (72). They were assigned randomly to two groups: rTMS group (n = 7) and sham stimulation group (n = 6). The patients received ﬁve sessions of either high-frequency rTMS over the region spanning from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or sham stimulation for 5 days. The severity of apathy was evaluated using the Apathy Scale (AS) and the severity of depression was evaluated using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) serially before and after the 5-day protocol (2000 pulses per session). The AS and QIDS scores were signiﬁcantly improved in the rTMS group, although they were not changed in the sham stimulation group.\nZack et al. (73) reported that rTMS and cTBS can reduce gambling reinforcement in nine noncomorbid men with pathological gambling. The authors used a P/N 9902–00 DCC by Magstim to stimulate the mPFC (neuronavigated target positioning). Interestingly, stimulation intensities were set at 80% of the active motor threshold (AMT) of the tibialis anterior muscle. The experiment was set up in a repeated-measure, Latin square design applying TMS shortly before a slot machine game, stroop task, delay discounting task and several psychometric assessment scores.\nDISCUSSION\nVariability in Terminology and Methodology One of the major ﬁndings of our literature search was the fact\nthat DCC stimulation of the ACC by placement of the coil over the dmPFC was conducted by both researchers and clinicians in a broad range of indications and conditions reaching from basic research in healthy subjects to a variety of clinical applications. Unfortunately, no common nomenclature of this kind of stimulation has been consistently conducted impeding a detailed and quick overview of the available literature on the topic. In some cases, the dmPFC has been stated as primary target without mentioning the ACC at all, other manuscripts only focused on the ACC as target of the stimulation. Moreover, differences in the application of dmPFC-DCC--rTMS are not limited to terminological conventions. In addition, we found a large variability in several aspects such as coil positioning, stimulation intensity, number of pulses, number of sessions, stimulation frequency, and intertrain intervals. Most studies used high (>5 Hz) and low (<5 Hz) stimulation frequencies according to the “rule of thumb” that high-frequency stimulation should exert excitatory and low-frequency stimulation should exert inhibitory effects on neural activity. This “rule of thumb” has been derived from rTMS of the motor cortex and assessment of cortical excitability by magnetically evoked motor potentials (MEPs) (74–76). However, the question remains open whether this basic rule may be easily transferred to other cortical areas in an unmodiﬁed way especially with regard to the ACC.\nThe ACC contains several subregions, at least the dACC and the subgenual ACC (sgACC). The former is closely connected to the prefrontal cortex and plays a critical role in cognitive-emotional processing (77), the latter seems to be closely involved in emotion recognition (78). The activity of the dACC and the sgACC seem to be functionally anticorrelated, what has been shown in different conditions such as depressive states and experimentally induced\n\n12\n\nwww.neuromodulationjournal.com\n\n© 2018 International Neuromodulation Society\n\nNeuromodulation 2018; ••: ••–••\n\nDORSOMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX DCC rTMS\n\nsadness, and on the contrary during antidepressant treatment (cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medication, deep brain stimulation, etc.) (30). This interaction of dACC and sgACC has also been found in the only study that investigated the effects of dmPFC-DCC-stimulation by neuroimaging (12). This study revealed that cerebral blood ﬂow was increased in the dACC and reduced in sgACC after 10 Hz dmPFC-DCC-stimulation. Thus, more research investigating the effects of different stimulation parameters on the activity of the different subdivisions of the ACC is needed. In addition to the relevance of the stimulation frequency also the effect of stimulation intensity should be further explored. This is particularly important for the comparison of effects observed in different studies, as our literature search revealed that even basic principles, such as the recommendation to adapt the individual stimulation intensity according to the participant’s/patient’s resting motor threshold, was not conducted in the same manner in all studies: some groups referred to the detection of the individual motor threshold by means of a conventional ﬁgure-of-8-coil M1-stimulation of the arms transferring this parameter 1:1 to the double-cone-coil-stimulation, others implemented the M1-stimulation of the legs (in most cases the tibialis-anterior-muscle) as basic parameter for the determination of the ﬁnal stimulation intensity (see Table 2 for details). This is based on the assumption that the M1-region of the lower extremities is located in a similar distance from the surface of the brain (practically: the scull) as the ACC target. Different positioning methods (neuronavigated positioning following anatomic landmarks vs. target-based landmarks vs. 10-20-EEG-system based positioning without the use of neuronavigation tools) have been applied and some groups (e.g., Downar and colleagues) conducted the stimulation with the handle of the coil pointing toward the ear according to Terao (79,80) following the procedure described by Harmer (81), others (e.g., Langguth, de Ridder) conducted the stimulation with the coil handle pointing backward following the concept of Hayward et al. (12).\nMost important of all, a comprehensive review of the available literature revealed that these parameters of stimulation have not even been stated clearly in each single manuscript. Therefore, we would strongly suggest that each kind of manuscript reporting effects derived from double cone rTMS of the dmPFC/ACC should contain 1) at least the keywords: “dmPFC; ACC; rTMS; DCC) for easy identiﬁcation of manuscripts dealing with the topic and enhanced accessibility of knowledge, 2) a detailed description of the stimulation equipment, namely the manufacturer and exact coil type applied in the trial, 3) a detailed description of the coil positioning procedures (e.g., neuro-navigation according to anatomical landmarks or functional data; coil positioning based on anatomical landmarks without neuro-navigation according to 10-20-EEG-system or another algorithm), detailed clariﬁcation of coil orientation (such as “handle pointing backwards or turned in a 90  angle to the left or the right”), 4) the detailed stimulation parameters (stimulation intensity, frequency, number of sessions, scheduling of sessions (sequential workdays; 2 days per week, etc.), number of x trains consisting of y stimuli with and intertrain interval of z sec (x*y = number of pulses per session, 5) procedures to assess the individual motor threshold (RMT; upper or lower extremity? Figure-of-eight-coil or DCC used to determine the RMT?), 6) detailed assessment and reports of adverse effects regarding the stimulation (e.g., many reports and clinical experiences indicate reduced tolerability of dmPFC-DCCrTMS stimulation compared to conventional rTMS with ﬁgure-ofeight-coils leading to a (in relation to the RMT) reduced\n\nstimulation intensity of dmPFC-DCC-stimulation to assure compliance of participants).\nSafety Safety data from conventional rTMS applications (4) cannot be\ndirectly applied to the use of the DCC over the medial prefrontal cortex. From a safety perspective both the deeper and the broader effect of dmPFC-DCC-stimulation require a speciﬁc assessment of its safety. Also with respect to safety several methodological uncertainties and differences across studies have to be kept in mind. Even if available studies have not provided any hint for severe side effects, it has to be considered that the total number of investigated cases is still small and the largest study is based on a retrospective chart review, which bears the risk of underreporting of side effects. In our own experience, patients report the sensory sensation during stimulation as being more inconvenient than those in standard rTMS, particularly at higher stimulation intensities and frequencies. Similar observations are also reported by others. For example, Vanneste and colleagues (51) suggested dmPFC-DCC-stimulation as a treatment approach in affective disorders in 2014 and reported the successful treatment of a single patient suffering from treatment resistant depression. However, the patient was—although showing a relatively high RMT of 65% MSO—treated with a stimulation intensity of only 40% MSO because higher intensities were not well tolerated in this case.\nIn one study (59), cognitive function was systematically assessed in 21 depressive patients that underwent ten sessions of dmPFC-rTMS. The study demonstrated an improvement of cognitive function that was unrelated to improvement of depressive symptoms. Even if results of this open label study have to be interpreted with care, they at least suggest that this kind of rTMS might not worsen cognitive function. Taken together, the available data do not suggest any particular risk of dmPFC-DCC-rTMS, but the systematic assessment of safety data is strongly encouraged in future studies.\nThe Impact of Stimulation Protocols The effects of single sessions of dmPFC-DCC-rTMS were assessed\nin patients with chronic tinnitus (52–54) and in healthy controls. In tinnitus patients a transient reduction of tinnitus after rTMS was observed for low frequencies of rTMS (1, 3 Hz) whereas higher frequencies (5, 20 Hz) did not yield better results than sham stimulation (52). Positive effects of single sessions could be prolonged by repeated sessions (53) and by epidural cortical implants (54).\nOne study in healthy controls combined TMS with neuroimaging (12) and revealed an increase of cerebral blood ﬂow in the dACC and a decrease in the sgACC after 10 Hz dmPFC-DCCstimulation. All other single session studies focused on the induction of transient behavioral effects in healthy controls. Based on the assumed ability to interfere with the ACC, effects on social interactions and theory of mind functions were investigated. In a theory-of-mind task of 1 Hz dmPFC-DCC-rTMS increased reaction times for answers about another’s beliefs and reduced reaction times for answers about own beliefs. This result conﬁrms the assumption that the medial prefrontal cortex is causally involved in perspective change and that its activity can be decreased by low frequency dmPFC-DCC-rTMS. The inhibitory effect of 1 Hz dmPFC-DCC-rTMS on ACC activity was conﬁrmed by other studies in which single sessions of this protocol reduced electrophysiological and perceptual aspects of pain (49,70).\n\n13\n\nwww.neuromodulationjournal.com\n\n© 2018 International Neuromodulation Society\n\nNeuromodulation 2018; ••: ••–••\n\nKREUZER ET AL.\n\nBehavioral data also suggest that continuous theta burst stimulation over the mPFC transiently reduces mPFC function resulting in reduced inhibitory control on prosocial behavior (44) or reduced adjustment following perceived conﬂicts between either own and group behavior (46) or between expected and perceived conditions (45).\nIn contrast to the single session studies, in which mostly inhibitory protocols (1 Hz, cTBS) were used, most clinical applications of dmPFC-DCC-stimulation were performed at a frequency of 10 Hz. 10 Hz rTMS with the DCC over the mPFC has been shown to increase cerebral blood ﬂow in the dACC (12). Based on this ﬁnding 10 Hz dmPFC-DCC-rTMS has mainly been applied for the treatment of depression (57,62,63,68). Practically all available studies suggest an antidepressant effect (57,62,63,68), although only one study has been sham-controlled (68). Moreover, imaging studies revealed brain connectivity changes in treatment responders without a clear pattern across studies. In OCD both treatment with 10 Hz (56) and 1 Hz (66,67) resulted in symptom improvement. Further indications in which dmPFC-DCC-rTMS was explored include binge/purge behavior, bulimia, alcohol craving, tinnitus, and ﬁbromyalgia (49,50,52–55,58,69).\nCONCLUSION\nTaken together the available clinical results indicate the potential of dmPFC-DCC-rTMS. However, both preclinical parameter studies combining TMS with neuroimaging and controlled clinical studies are urgently needed for further development of this promising new TMS approach.\nTake Home Message Taken together, DCC rTMS of the dmPFC/ACC region represents\na promising and innovative neuromodulatory approach both with regard to a) theoretical backgrounds (such as the “common core hypothesis” of all psychiatric disorders of Goodkind (35), and Downar and colleagues (37)), b) basic research (e.g., the PETbased studies by Hayward and colleagues (12)) and c) clinical research (e.g. (41,51,57)). However, during the literature search for this review the authors were challenged by the enormous heterogeneity of terminology and the great variability of the applied stimulation paradigms. Most important of all, in the majority of the reviewed manuscripts (even our own ones), especially those from clinical research, crucial pieces of information (e.g., the coil orientation with the handle pointing backwards or twisted in a 90  angle) were consistently missing. Available data support the notion, that the ACC can be stimulated by DCC rTMS. To further exploit this potential basic research involving fMRI, PET, and EEGmethods as well as computational engineering and magnetic ﬁeld simulations might help to clarify the underlying neurobiological mechanisms and the exact spatial extension of the magnetic ﬁeld. Moreover, the research ﬁeld would greatly beneﬁt from a uniform nomenclature and detailed reporting of all relevant details of the stimulation procedure.\nAuthorship Statements\nPeter M.
