However, the antidepressant mechanism remains unknown and its therapeutic efficacy remains limited. Recent data suggest that some left DLPFC targets are more effective than others; however, the reasons for this heterogeneity and how to capitalize on this information remain unclear. \nMethods \n \nIntrinsic (resting state) functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 98 normal subjects were used to compute functional connectivity with various left DLPFC TMS targets employed in the literature. Differences in functional connectivity related to differences in previously reported clinical efficacy were identified. This information was translated into a connectivity-based targeting strategy to identify optimized left DLPFC TMS coordinates. Results in normal subjects were tested for reproducibility in an independent cohort of 13 patients with depression. \nResults \n \nDifferences in functional connectivity were related to previously reported differences in clinical efficacy across a distributed set of cortical and limbic regions. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex TMS sites with better clinical efficacy were more negatively correlated (anticorrelated) with the subgenual cingulate. Optimum connectivity-based stimulation coordinates were identified in Brodmann area 46 . Results were reproducible in patients with depression. \nConclusions \n \nReported antidepressant efficacy of different left DLPFC TMS sites is related to the anticorrelation of each site with the subgenual cingulate, potentially lending insight into the antidepressant mechanism of TMS and suggesting a role for intrinsically anticorrelated networks in depression. These results can be translated into a connectivity-based targeting strategy for focal brain stimulation that might be used to optimize clinical response. \nSection snippets \nMethods and Materials \n \nFull methodological details can be found in Supplement 1. Two datasets collected at different sites were used in the present analysis. The first consisted of 98 healthy right-handed subjects (48 male subjects, ages 22 ± 3.2 years [mean ± SD]). The second dataset consisted of 13 right-handed subjects with major depressive disorder (3 male subjects, mean age 40.2 years, mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D] 23.8) and 11 healthy control subjects (5 male subject, mean age 29 years, mean \nResults \n \nWe first determined whether the different left DLPFC stimulation sites suggested in the literature showed heterogeneity in their underlying functional connectivity, both on a voxelwise basis and specifically with our a priori defined region of interest in the subgenual cingulate (Figure 1). Clear differences in functional connectivity were observed across multiple regions in the subgenual, medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and anterior cingulate. Interestingly, all DLPFC sites tested showed a \nDiscussion \n \nIn the current article, we used a novel connectivity-based approach to gain insight into why some left DLPFC TMS targets have proven more clinically effective than others. We identified robust differences in functional connectivity related to previously reported differences in clinical efficacy, particularly anticorrelation with the subgenual cingulate. We then demonstrated how one could translate this information into a connectivity-based targeting technique to identify coordinates in the left \nReferences (73) \n \n    M.
