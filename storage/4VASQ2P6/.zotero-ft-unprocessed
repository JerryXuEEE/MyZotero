Nevertheless, little is known about the underlying neuropathological origin of MDD, particularly based on distinct trajectories of brain atrophy. Here, using the data-driven subtype and stage inference algorithm on large case–control magnetic resonance imaging data from 3,940 individuals (1,789 patients with MDD; 2,151 healthy controls), we demonstrated three highly robust spatiotemporal MDD subtypes: subtype 1 initiates from the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, subtype 2 starts at the hippocampus and subtype 3 begins in the superior frontal gyrus and then the orbitofrontal cortex. These subtypes also exhibited distinct clinical profiles and differing transcriptomic gene expressions. Specifically, we identified suicide risk as the characteristic symptom for the ‘anterior cingulate cortex-led’ subtype, as well as low motivation (for example, work interests) for the ‘frontal-led’ and somatic anxiety for the ‘hippocampusled’. Distinguishable cell type-specific transcriptional signatures further indicate distinct origins of MDD subtypes. Together, our data-driven findings demonstrate different spatiotemporal trajectories of MDD subtypes, which may contribute to the potential for individualized diagnostics, suicide risk alerts and optimizing therapeutic targeting.\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common major public health issue and a global leading cause of disability1. Behavioural symp-\ntoms such as feelings of sadness and helplessness, loss of pleasure\nand lack of motivation and cognitive deficits are key features of MDD2,3. The diagnosis of MDD is guided by subjective behavioural\n\nsymptoms rather than objective indices with remarkable heteroge-\nneity in phenotypic presentation, aetiology and longitudinal trajectory4–6. Emerging consensus suggests MDD may consist of multiple subtypes4,7,8. However, few studies have managed to demonstrate\nwhether highly reproducible neuropathological features, such as\n\n1Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. 2Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence (Fudan University), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China. 3Medical Psychological Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China. 4Medical Psychological Institute, Central South University, Changsha, China. 5China National Clinical Research Center on Mental Disorders (Xiangya), Changsha, China. 6Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 7Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, SGDP Centre, King’s College London, London, UK. 8Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. 9Fudan ISTBI—ZJNU Algorithm Centre for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, China. 10Shanghai Medical College and Zhongshan Hospital Immunotherapy Technology Transfer Center, Shanghai, China. 11MOE Frontiers Center for Brain Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. 12Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK. 13These authors contributed equally: Di Chen, Xiang Wang, Valerie Voon. *Lists of authors and their affiliations appear at the end of the paper.  e-mail: tianyejia@fudan.edu.cn; wcheng@fudan.edu.cn; jffeng@fudan.edu.cn\nNature Mental Health\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-023-00139-4\n\na Discovery sample\nREST-meta-MDD consortium MDD\nn = 1,151\nHC n = 1,064\nMRI-T1\n\nb Imaging processing\nVBM preprocessing\n\nAAL template\n\nAdjust harmful variable\n\nc Characteristic matrix\n\nR1 R2 ...\n\nR19\n\nPatient 1\n\nPatient 2\n\n...\n\nPatient 1,151\n\nf\n\nReplication dataset 1\n\nJapan DecNef Project\n\nMDD, n = 253 HC, n = 585\n\nR1 R2 ...\n\nR19\n\nPatient 1\n\nPatient 2\n\n...\n\nReplication dataset 2 Second Xiangya Hospital\n\nMDD, n = 385 HC, n = 502\n\nR1 R2 ...\n\nR19\n\nPatient 1\n\nPatient 2\n\n...\n\nPatient 253\n\nPatient 385\n\nSubtyping independent MDD patients\n\nOrder similarity\n\nValidated the atrophy trajectory of MDD subtypes\n\nd\n\nData-driven neural atrophy algorithm\n\ne Subtyping\nSubtype 1 ACC-led\n\nStage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV Stage V\n\nSubtype 2 Hippocampus-led\nSubtype 3 Frontal-led\n\nResidualized HAMD score Residualized HAMD score Residualized HAMD score\n\ng Distinct clinical pro iles\n\nF = 3.24 4 P = 0.041\n\nSuicide P = 0.0095\n\n2\n\nF = 3.41 P = 0.035\n2\n\nSomatic anxiety P = 0.0109\n\nWork and interests\n\nF = 5.17 P = 0.006\nP = 0.0022\n\nP = 0.0074\n\n2\n\n0 0 0\n\n–2 –2 –2\n\nACCled\n\nFrontal- Hippocampus-\n\nled\n\nled\n\nACCled\n\nFrontal- Hippocampus-\n\nled\n\nled\n\nACCled\n\nFrontal- Hippocampus-\n\nled\n\nled\n\nh\n\nDi ering transcriptomic gene expressions\n\ni Disparate MDD-related gene expression\n\nHippocampus-led\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\nr value\n\nFrontal-led\n\nACC-led\n\n*\n\n*\n\n0.1 0\n\n–0.1\n\n–0.2\n\n*\n\n***\n\n–0.3\n\nADRA2ACHRM2 CNR1 CRH CUX2 GAD2 HTR1AHTR5A MAOA PDE1A SST TAC1\n\nFig. 1 | Schematic overview of the present study.

From the large-scale Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis consortium, patients with MDD show reduced volume of the hippocampus11 and lower cortical thickness in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, fusiform gyrus, superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and temporal lobe13–16. Mid cingulate structural findings are also functionally associated with the experience of negative affect and pain in MDD17. Previous functional MRI studies further identified OFC, hippocampus, ACC, insula, middle frontal gyrus and rectus regions as enriched hubs that distinguish MDD from HCs5,18–21.\nBeyond the simple categorization of pathological versus healthy groups, studies have also explored the use of neuroanatomical (grey matter density) features to identify subtype of MDD7,22. Most notably, the subtype and stage inference (SuStaIn) algorithm in neuroscience has provided insights into how differing mechanisms underlying volumetric changes and anatomical atrophy might result in heterogeneous clinical presentations of mental disorders23–25.\n\nThe SuStaIn model is based on the Bayesian inversion of a generative model of disease progression23. This model assumes the existence of an unknown number of subtypes, each characterized by distinct progressive patterns of disease biomarkers, specifically changes in grey matter density over the brain. These ‘trajectories’ are represented as ordered sequences of progressive biomarker changes corresponding to different disease stages23. To generate a sample from this model, a specific subtype and stage are selected to produce a pattern of biomarkers. Importantly, this approach allows for the reconstruction of ‘trajectories’ for each subtype using cross-sectional data, by identifying the best subgroup and disease stage for each subject. Through model inversion, it becomes possible to assign a probability to each subject indicating their likelihood of belonging to a particular subgroup and stage of disease progression. By effectively disentangling the subtype and stage, this generative model inversion uncovers the underlying causes of measurable pathology. The inversion process of this generative model employs standard procedures such as expectation maximization and Markov chain Monte Carlo23. Using the SuStaIn model, based on cross-sectional samples, we focus on characterizing anatomical volumetric changes contributing to heterogeneity, particularly on predicted ‘trajectory’ (that is, the most probable sequence of spatial progression) that contributes to grey matter atrophy.\n\nNature Mental Health\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-023-00139-4\n\nIn this Article, we applied the SuStaIn algorithm to grey matter volume (GMV), as characterized by voxel-based morphometry, in a large neuroimaging cohort (that is, nMDD = 1,151, nHC = 1,064) of the REST-meta-MDD project10,26. Using Bayesian model selection, we identified the number of subtypes and validated the associated patterns of atrophy in two replication studies (nMDD = 253, nHC = 585 for the DecNef Project from Japan27; nMDD = 385, nHC = 502 from the Second Xiangya Hospital project). Having established the predictive validity of the model, we then present a series of construct validations by showing notable correlations with clinical phenotypes. To investigate different potential genetic factors of MDD subtypes, we also employed the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) microarray dataset (http://human.brainmap.org), which has been used to identify transcriptomics associated with the pattern of specific disease progression28. Figure 1 provides an overview of this present study.\nResults\nWhole-brain analysis of brain GMV We first identified the most distinguishable brain patterns between MDD and healthy controls through GMV using a whole-brain analysis approach. Using the Automated Anatomical Labeling Atlas (AAL)-2 brain template, we identified whole-brain region of interest (ROI)based differences (Fig. 2a) after controlling for factors including total intracranial volume (TIV), age, sex, years of education and site in the REST-meta-MDD project (nMDD = 1,151, nHC = 1,064; Supplementary Table 1); for details, see Supplementary Table 2.\nUsing the replication dataset from the Japan DecNef Project (nMDD = 253, nHC = 585; Supplementary Table 1), we also confirmed this MDD brain pattern using the same whole-brain ROI-based analysis procedure (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). We observed a significant correlation of ROI-based brain pattern differences (that is, case–control t values) between the REST-meta-MDD project and the Japan DecNef Project (Spearman r = 0.44, Ppermu = 0.002 after 10,000 times of standard permutation flow; Supplementary Fig. 2), thus confirming the consistency of the identified MDD brain pattern. In the second replication cohort from the Second Xiangya Hospital, however, we did not observe a significant pattern similarity (P = 0.7856) with the discovery data. This is probably due to a much younger age in the second replication cohort (mean age 22.21 years, standard deviation (s.d.) 5.22 years; nMDD = 385, nHC = 502) in contrast with the discovery dataset (mean age 36.80 years, s.d. 15.08 years; nMDD = 1,151, nHC = 1,064). Indeed, after partitioning the second replication cohort individuals into adolescents (age <21 years) and adults (age ≥21 years) (that is, adolescents: age <21 years, nMDD = 173, nHC = 277, mean age 18.92 years, s.d. 1.13 years; adults: age ≥21 years, nMDD = 212, nHC = 225, mean age 25.60 years, s.d. 5.60 years), we found that the adult group (Spearman radults = 0.18) had a significantly higher similarity with the discovery datasets than the adolescent group (Spearman r = −0.16) (rdif = 0.34, Ppermu = 0.0454 based on 10,000 times permutation).\nIdentification of topological subtype of MDD We then applied the SuStaIn algorithm to identify distinct sustained brain atrophy throughout all progressive stages, that is, the ‘trajectories’25, from 2,215 individuals (nMDD = 1,151, nHC = 1,064; Supplementary\n\nTable 1) of the REST-meta-MDD project. Due to the distribution of average negative log-likelihood from five-fold validation, a threecluster partition was the optimal choice (for details, see Methods), which showed the minimum cross-validation information criterion (CVIC) (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and maximal log-likelihood (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The following three MDD subtypes with distinct ‘trajectories’ were identified from the SuStaIn model: subtype 1 showed initial atrophy starting in the subgenual ACC, then progressing to the supracallosal ACC, to the pregenual ACC and finally to the middle cingulate gyri (Fig. 2b). Subtype 2 exhibited atrophy starting in the hippocampus, then progressing to temporal regions and the fusiform gyrus (Fig. 2b). Subtype 3 displayed atrophy beginning in the SFG, then progressing to the middle frontal gyrus and ultimately to the OFC (Fig. 2b).\nThe SuStaIn algorithm assigned each patient with MDD of the REST-meta-MDD project (nMDD = 1,151; Fig. 2c) to the most probable subtype label and atrophy stage. Note that patients with MDD in ‘stage 0’ in the atrophy stage were identified as ‘pre-atrophy’, while other patients were defined as ‘post-atrophy’ in the present study. A total of 433 patients with MDD (37.62% of the total) were classified as subtype 1, which was further divided into ‘pre-atrophy’ (npre = 187 for subtype 1) or ‘post-atrophy’ (that is, ‘ACC-led’; nACC = 246) phase. The subtype 2 patients with MDD (nsubtype2 = 486, 42.22% of the total) were also assigned to ‘pre-atrophy’ (npre = 249 for subtype 2) or ‘postatrophy’ (that is, ‘hippocampus-led’, nhippocampus = 237) phase, as well as the subtype 3 (nsubtype3 = 232, 20.16% of the total; npre = 72 for subtype3, nfrontal = 160). The probability-based distribution of three post-atrophy ‘trajectories’ (that is, ‘ACC-led’, ‘hippocampus-led’ and ‘frontal-led’) from the REST-meta-MDD project can be found in Fig. 2d. We then investigated the influence of confounders (that is, medication history, age, sex and education) on MDD subtypes and found no potential impact (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4).\nTo further characterize the stage-based progression of atrophy for patients with MDD from the REST-meta-MDD project, we calculated the mean z-value images (that is, reduction of GMV) and investigated their relationship with SuStaIn stage. The decrease of ROI-based GMV (that is, increasing z-value) for each subtype (that is, ‘post-atrophy’) is shown in Fig. 2e. In addition, reduced total GMV (r = −0.29, PBonferroni < 0.001, Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 2f), increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (r = 0.56, PBonferroni < 0.001, Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 2g), and a trend towards larger white matter volume (WMV) were also observed with increased SuStaIn stages (r = 0.07, PBonferroni = 0.066, Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 2h).\nWe then investigated the relationship between ROI-based GMV (z-value) and SuStaIn stage. As expected, we observed the z-valued GMV of ACC significantly correlated with the SuStaIn stage in the ‘ACC-led’ subtype (r = 0.11, PFDR = 0.048 for subgenual ACC; r = 0.52, PFDR < 0.001 for pregenual ACC; r = 0.36, PFDR < 0.001 for supracallosal ACC; false discovery rate (FDR) corrected). The GMV of the hippocampus (z-value) was also associated with the SuStaIn stage in the ‘hippocampus-led’ subtype (r = 0.26, PFDR < 0.001; FDR corrected). A significant correlation of the ‘frontal-led’ subtype was similarly found in OFC (r = 0.58, PFDR < 0.001 for medial OFC; r = 0.44,\n\nFig. 2 | Identified topological subtype of MDD from the REST-meta-MDD project. a, ROI-based group differences of the REST-meta-MDD project in GMV between patients with MDD and HCs.

The observed SuStaIn exportation (that is, order of atrophy ‘trajectory’) in both replication datasets showed significant consistency with the discovery dataset of the REST-meta-MDD project ( Japan DecNef Project: r = 0.47, Pone-tailed < 0.001 for subtype 1; r = 0.47, Pone-tailed < 0.001 for subtype 2; r = 0.57, Pone-tailed < 0.001 for subtype 3; FDR corrected; Fig. 3e; Second Xiangya Hospital: r = 0.66, Pone-tailed < 0.001 for subtype 1; r = 0.36, Pone-tailed = 0.003 for subtype 2; r = 0.35, Pone-tailed = 0.004 for subtype 3; FDR corrected; Fig. 3f).

Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)29,30 conducted to evaluate group differences among three MDD subtypes (that is, ‘ACC-led’, ‘hippocampus-led’ and ‘frontal-led’) across all 17 Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) items found significant results (η = 0.22, adjusted η = 0.11, Ppermu = 0.0008 based on 10,000 permutation iterations; Fig. 4a). With the significant MANOVA finding, we then conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to explore each HAMD item’s group differences among MDD subtypes.\n\nNature Mental Health\n\nArticle\n\na\n\n15\n\n10\n\nEta = 0.22 Ppermu = 0.0008\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-023-00139-4\n\nb\nF = 3.24 4 P = 0.041\n\nSuicide P = 0.0095\n\n2\n\nResidualized HAMD score\n\nDensity\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\nEta value\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nc\n\nSomatic anxiety\n\nF = 3.41 P = 0.035\n\nP = 0.0109\n\n2\n\n0\n\n–2\n\nACC-led\n\nFrontal-led Hippocampus-led\n\nd\n\nWork and interests\n\nF = 5.17\n\nP = 0.006\n\nP = 0.0074\n\nP = 0.0022\n\n2\n\nResidualized HAMD score\n\nResidualized HAMD score\n\n0 0\n\n–2 –2\n\nACC-led\n\nFrontal-ledHippocampus-led\n\nACC-led\n\nFrontal-led Hippocampus-led\n\ne\n\nSuicide\n\nSomatic anxiety\n\nWork and interests\n\nL\n\nRL\n\nRL\n\nR\n\nSubtype 1 ACC-led\n\nL\n\nRL\n\nRL\n\nR\n\nSubtype 2 Hippocampus-led\n\nL\n\nRL\n\nRL\n\nR\n\nSubtype 3 Frontal-led\n\n–0.3\n\n–0.1\n\nr value\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\nr value\n\nFig. 4 | MDD subtypes are characterized by distinct clinical profiles. a, Eta values of 10,000 times permutation flow; one-tailed P value. b–d, Characteristic symptoms; ‘suicide’ risk score (b), ‘somatic anxiety’ behavioural score (c) and ‘work and interests’ score (d). nACC-led = 93, nhippocampus-led = 106, nfrontal-led = 77; independent samples.

For clarity of presentation, the following terms were restricted to include only the HAMD items with a significant one-way ANOVA (that is, P < 0.05). Confounding factors including age, sex, years of education and site were first regressed out from the behavioural analyses.\nThe ‘ACC-led’ subtype displayed a high ‘suicide’ risk score (ANOVA: F = 3.24, P = 0.041; t = 2.62, Cohen’s d = 0.37, Ptwo-tailed = 0.0095, nACC-led = 93, nhippocampus-led = 106 for ‘ACC-led’ versus ‘hippocampus-led’; Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 5). In contrast, the ‘hippocampus-led’ subtype exhibited high ‘somatic anxiety’ behavioural scores (ANOVA: F = 3.41, P = 0.035; t = −2.57, Cohen’s d = −0.37, Ptwo-tailed = 0.0109, nACC-led = 93, nhippocampus-led = 106 for ‘ACC-led’ versus ‘hippocampusled’; Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 5), whereas the ‘frontal-led’ showed impaired ‘work and interests’ score (ANOVA: F = 5.17, P = 0.006; t = −3.10, Cohen’s d = −0.48, Ptwo-tailed = 0.0022, nACC-led = 93, nfrontal-led = 77, for ‘ACC-led’ versus ‘frontal-led’; t = −2.71, Cohen’s d = −0.41, Ptwo-tailed = 0.0074, nhippocampus-led = 106, nfrontal-led = 77 for ‘hippocampusled’ versus ‘frontal-led’; Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 5). In addition, the distinct relationships between brain atrophy of MDD subtypes and characteristic profiles were also observed (that is, higher z-scored GMV was positively associated with increasing symptoms; Fig. 4e), which again support behavioural differences among MDD subtypes.\nCharacterization of MDD subtypes by gene expression patterns We first conducted a whole-brain voxel-based analysis of GMV contrasting three distinct ‘post-atrophy’ MDD subtypes to healthy controls. We then conducted the partial least square (PLS) analysis32 to ascertain the relationship between the voxel-based case–control differences (that is, the whole-brain t-map) of each subtype and the transcriptional activities of all 10,027 genes from AHBA. The derived first component of gene expression (PLS1) was the linear combination of gene expression that captured the greatest fraction of case–control GMV difference. As a result, the MDD brain pattern (that is, voxel-based case–control t-map) of the ‘ACC-led’ subtype demonstrated a significant correlation with its PLS1 (r = 0.36, Ppermu < 0.001, Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 5a) after 1,000 iterations of standard permutation flow, as well as the ‘hippocampusled’ subtype (r = 0.42, Ppermu < 0.001, Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 5b), but not for the ‘frontal-led’ subtype (r = 0.21, Ppermu = 0.351, Bonferroni corrected; Fig. 5c).\nThe gene-wise approach was then adopted to explore associations between the whole-brain t-maps of MDD subtypes and the transcriptional activity for each of the 10,027 genes. We first ranked the weights of PLS1 by one-sample z-tests. Using a stringent threshold (z > 5 for PLS1+ or z < −5 for PLS1−), we then identified 3,600 genes (n = 1,883 for PLS1+, n = 1,717 for PLS1−; all PFDR < 0.001) for the ‘ACC-led’, 3,167 genes (n = 1,874 for PLS1+, n = 1,293 for PLS1−; all PFDR < 0.001) for the ‘hippocampus-led’, and 1,480 genes (n = 486 for PLS1+, n = 994 for PLS1−; all PFDR < 0.001) for the ‘frontal-led’. Finally, to characterize the biological functions of these identified genes, we conducted the enrichment analyses based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) using the R package ‘clusterProfiler’33.\nAfter FDR correction (PFDR < 0.05), we identified two significant GO terms (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7) related to vessel formation enriched with ‘ACC-led’ PLS1+ genes (that is, ‘endothelium development’ and ‘endothelial cell differentiation’). Interestingly, the endothelial progenitor cells that underlie blood vessel regeneration have long been associated with depressive symptoms, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear34–36. In addition, 66 GO terms (for example, ‘vesicle-mediated transport in synapse’; Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 7) and 13 KEGG pathways, such as\n\n‘neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction’, were enriched with ‘ACCled’ PLS1− genes (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 7).\nFurther, we identified 31 GO terms (for example, ‘RNA processing’; Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 8) and 2 KEGG pathways (for example, ‘ribosome’; Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Fig. 8) for the ‘hippocampus-led’ PLS1+ genes, as well as 123 GO terms (for example, ‘axon development’ and ‘neuron projection morphogenesis’; Supplementary Table 11 and Supplementary Fig. 8) and 4 KEGG pathways (for example, ‘axon guidance’ and ‘neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction’) for ‘hippocampus-led’ PLS1− genes (Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Fig. 8).\nFinally, we identified 11 GO terms (for example, ‘regulation of tissue remodelling’; Supplementary Table 13 and Supplementary Fig. 9) and 3 KEGG pathways (that is, ‘notch signalling pathway’; Supplementary Table 14 and Supplementary Fig. 9) enriched with ‘frontal-led’ PLS1+ genes, and 26 GO terms (for example, ‘distal axon’; Supplementary Table 15 and Supplementary Fig. 9) and 2 KEGG pathways (for example, ‘neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction’; Supplementary Table 16 and Supplementary Fig. 9) enriched with ‘frontal-led’ PLS1− genes.\nDifferentiated MDD gene expression patterns of MDD subtypes The first and second principal component analysis (that is, PCA1 and PCA2) scores of 12 MDD-related genes (‘ADRA2A’, ‘CHRM2’, ‘CNR1’, ‘CRH’, ‘CUX2’, ‘GAD2’, ‘HTR1A’, ‘HTR5A’, ‘MAOA’, ‘PDE1A’, ‘SST’ and ‘TAC1’; Supplementary Table 17; for more details, see Methods) were estimated to preserve the maximum amount of genetic information. We observed significant correlations between the PCA1 with the ‘ACC-led’ (r = 0.16, Ppermu = 0.032, FDR corrected; Fig. 5d) and ‘hippocampus-led’ brain pattern (r = 0.21, Ppermu = 0.004, FDR corrected; Fig. 5e), but not with the ‘frontal-led’ pattern (r = −0.02, Ppermu = 0.836, FDR corrected; Fig. 5f). Unlike PCA1, PCA2 demonstrated significant associations with both brain patterns of the ‘ACC-led’ (r = −0.29, Ppermu < 0.001, FDR corrected; Fig. 5d) and the ‘frontal-led’ (r = −0.19, Ppermu = 0.006, FDR corrected; Fig. 5f), but not with the ‘hippocampus-led’ (r = −0.07, Ppermu = 0.406, FDR corrected; Fig. 5e).\nWe further evaluated the relationships between MDD-related genes and distinct brain patterns of MDD subtypes. After 1,000 iterations of standard permutation flow and with FDR correction, we identified five MDD-related genes (that is, ‘CNR1’, ‘GAD2’, ‘HTR1A’, ‘MAOA’ and ‘SST’; Fig. 5g and Supplementary Table 18) that were significantly relevant (Ppermu < 0.001, FDR corrected) to the brain pattern for ‘hippocampus-led’ subtype, one gene for ‘frontal-led’ subtype (that is, ‘SST’; Fig. 5g and Supplementary Table 18) and five genes for ‘ACC-led’ subtype (that is, ‘CNR1’, ‘HTR1A’, ‘PDE1A’, ‘SST’ and ‘TAC1’; Fig. 5g and Supplementary Table 18). Notably, the ‘hippocampus-led’ patients with MDD showed specificity for ‘GAD2’ and ‘MAOA’ genes (r = 0.20, Ppermu < 0.001 for ‘GAD2’; r = −0.23, Ppermu < 0.001 for ‘MAOA’; FDR corrected) whereas ‘ACC-led’ individuals showed specificity for ‘PDE1A’ and ‘TAC1’ genes (r = −0.26, Ppermu < 0.001 for ‘PDE1A’; r = −0.13, Ppermu = 0.029 for ‘TAC1’; FDR corrected) (for details, see Fig. 5g and Supplementary Table 18).\nDiscussion\nThe progression of neural atrophy in MDD has been previously reported, but little is known about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, particularly their distinct progressive patterns or ‘trajectories’. Here, using the data-driven SuStaIn algorithm on a large clinical sample with neuroimaging, we highlighted three different ‘trajectories’ of spatiotemporal atrophy: the first ‘trajectory’ began with subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) atrophy that progressively encompassed the whole ACC; the second ‘trajectory’ showed initial hippocampal atrophy and progressively affected temporal substrates; and the third ‘trajectory’ initiated with SFG atrophy and progressed into the middle frontal and orbitofrontal cortices. These different anatomical ‘trajectories’ were also linked to distinct behavioural symptoms: suicide\n\nNature Mental Health\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-023-00139-4\n\na 0.10 r = 0.36 Ppermu < 0.001 0.05\n\nb 0.10 0.05 0\n\nc 0.10\nr = 0.21 Ppermu = 0.351\n0.05\n\nPLS1 score\n\nPLS1 score\n\nPLS1 score\n\n0 –0.05 0\n\n–0.05 –0.10\n\n–0.10 –0.15\n\nr = 0.42 Ppermu < 0.001\n\n–0.05\n\n–15\n\n–10\n\n–5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n–10\n\n–5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n–10\n\n–5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nt value of the ACC-led\n\nt value of the hippocampus-led\n\nt value of the frontal-led\n\nPCA1 score of MDD related genes\n\nPCA1 score of MDD related genes\n\nPCA1 score of MDD related genes\n\nd 2 r = 0.16\nPpermu = 0.032 1\n\ne2\n1\n\nf\n\n2\n\nr = –0.02\n\nPpermu = 0.836\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nPCA2 score of MDD related genes\n\n–1\n\n–2\n\n–15\n\n–10\n\n–5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nt value of the ACC-led\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n–0.5\n\n–1.0 –1.5\n\nr = –0.29 Ppermu < 0.001\n\n–15\n\n–10\n\n–5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nt value of the ACC-led\n\ng\n\nPCA2 score of MDD related genes\n\n–1\n\n–2\n\n–10\n\n–5\n\nr = 0.21 Ppermu = 0.004\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nt value of the hippocampus-led\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n–0.5\n\n–1.0\n\n–1.5\n\n–10\n\n–5\n\nr = –0.07 Ppermu = 0.406\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nt value of the hippocampus-led\n\nPCA2 score of MDD related genes\n\n–1\n\n–2\n\n–10\n\n–5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nt value of the frontal-led\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n–0.5\n\n–1.0 –1.5\n\nr = –0.19 Ppermu = 0.006\n\n–10\n\n–5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nt value of the frontal-led\n\nHippocampus–led\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\nr value\n\nFrontal–led\n\nACC–led\n\n*\n\n0.1\n\n*\n\n0\n\n–0.1\n\n–0.2\n\n–0.3\n\n*\n\n***\n\nADRA2A CHRM2\n\nCNR1\n\nCRH CUX2 GAD2 HTR1A HTR5A MAOA PDE1A\n\nSST TAC1\n\nFig. 5 | Distinct ‘gene expression–brain’ profiles of MDD subtypes. a–c, The first component of PLS (that is, PLS1) was employed to evaluate the relationship between the voxel-based case–control differences (that is, the whole-brain tmap) of each subtype (AAC-led (a), hippocampus-led (b) and frontal-led (c)) and the transcriptional activities of all 10,027 genes from AHBA; Pearson correlation test (one-tailed P value, Bonferroni corrected) was used. d–f, Associations\n\nbetween the first two principal components of 12 MDD-related genes and the whole-brain t-map of each MDD subtype (AAC-led (d), hippocampus-led (e) and frontal-led (f)); two-tailed P value, FDR corrected. g, MDD-related genes were differentially expressed in different MDD subtypes. The r values and P values can be found in Supplementary Table 18; all P values were evaluated with 1,000 times permutation; FDR-corrected two-tailed *P < 0.05.\n\nrisk was highest in patients from the ‘ACC-led’ subtype; somatic anxiety was primarily observed in the ‘hippocampus-led’ subtype; and loss of interest in daily life was most severe in the ‘frontal-led’ subtype. As further evidence to support the biological plausibility of the three distinct subtypes, we demonstrated specific gene expression patterns for each ‘trajectory’. Remarkably, the MDD-related genes were dissociable between the three different ‘trajectories’. Further, the robustness of the three atrophy subtypes was supported, not only by the moderate to large sample size in the discovery dataset, but also by validation in two independent datasets, hence illustrating the high reproducibility of the ‘trajectories’. Thus, we highlight the clinical implications of these three subtypes identified by spatiotemporal atrophy differentiation, behavioural markers and genetic differences in patients with MDD, which may be relevant for potential individualized diagnoses and predictions of clinical trajectories.\n\nThe ‘ACC-led’ subtype suggests the sgACC as a pathophysiological origin of MDD (Fig. 2b), which is in line with previous studies13,37–39. The sgACC shows extensive interactions with key features of MDD implicated across mood, somatic and cognitive symptoms and plays a critical role in regulating mood states, sustaining autonomic arousal and worsening negative MDD symptoms (for example, rumination)21,40. This ACC-origin theory is further supported by findings that young individuals with MDD show significantly reduced ACC γ-aminobutyric acid41. Finally, sgACC activity could be improved in MDD following multiple forms of successful therapeutic interventions, including psychotherapy, antidepressants and ketamine infusion42, and the sgACC is also the target for deep brain stimulation for MDD43 and its hypoconnectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is an effective biomarker to optimize repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting44. Together these findings highlighted\n\nNature Mental Health\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-023-00139-4\n\na potentially stratified treatment strategy targeting the ‘ACC-led’ subtype in therapeutic interventions.\nThe hippocampus is implicated as a brain region for emotional responses, learning and memory45 and converting short-term memory into long-term memory. Using the SuStaIn algorithm, we identified this brain area as the pathophysiological origin of the ‘hippocampus-led’ subtype, which is consistent with reductions of hippocampal volume observed in patients with early-onset MDD from previous studies11,46. In longitudinal studies, the hippocampal volume has also been reported to progressively decrease during the MDD disease course beyond that of normal ageing47, thus supporting hippocampal changes observed with SuStaIn stages.\nThe OFC plays a core role in emotion, pleasure and decision-making, representing the primary reinforcers’ reward value48. Patients with MDD show lower volumes of the SFG and OFC, in line with other structural MRI studies2,13. As a genetic verification from the UK Biobank study, the polygenic risk score of anhedonia has also shown an association with OFC volumes2,49. For the ‘frontal-led’ subtype of patients with MDD, we demonstrated the SFG and OFC as the neural origin. OFC abnormalities in patients with MDD have been reported to emerge early and have a negative effect on emotion regulation2,50, supporting the frontal-led theory. Resting-state functional connectivity in patients with MDD shows abnormalities within networks anchored on different OFC regions5. Furthermore, targeting the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex51 (adjacent to the SFG) and OFC52 with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has shown evidence for efficacy in MDD therapy. In summary, the identified MDD subtypes might be responsive to alternative targeting strategies.\nThe above argument was further supported by the findings that different MDD subtypes demonstrate distinct behavioural symptoms. Suicide risk was found highest for the ‘ACC-led’ subtype, moderate for the ‘hippocampus-led’ and lowest for the ‘frontal-led’ subtype (Fig. 4b), which converges well with previous studies2,53. Also, a decrease in dorsal ACC-pregenual ACC resting-state functional connectivity has been shown to correlate with a reduction in suicidal risk53. Further, the ‘frontal-led’ subtype displayed significantly higher impairment in ‘work and interests’ score than the other subtypes, indicating lower motivation for this subtype, which is in line with OFC’s implicated role in reward-guided learning and decision-making54. Finally, we showed a dedicated relationship between somatic anxiety and the ‘hippocampalled’ subtype. As MDD has also been reported as a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease55, further longitudinal studies investigating the clinical implications for this subtype in tracking memory deficits or as a prodromal state are needed. Furthermore, MDD-related genes also displayed differing transcriptional correlates of the three subtypes (Fig. 5g), indicating distinct origins and confirming biological plausibility for differentiating these ‘trajectories’. These findings demonstrated that characteristic symptoms linked to these ‘trajectories’ may contribute to individualized diagnoses, highlighting the risk for suicide and optimal therapeutic targeting.\nFinally, the identified MDD subtypes are highly robust, as they have been successfully replicated in two independent cohorts (Fig. 3a,c), and they also demonstrate highly similar trajectories in the presence or absence of medical treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4). However, while we acknowledge that different classes of medication may have different impacts on the progression of MDD subtypes, our current datasets do not have relevant information. Therefore, future research focusing on different medications would be useful to further our understanding of brain atrophy in MDD.\nIn conclusion, we identified three highly robust ‘trajectories’ of brain atrophy in patients with MDD starting in the sgACC, hippocampus and SFG/OFC, respectively, and each ‘trajectory’ demonstrates distinct clinical profiles and transcriptomic correlates. Our data-driven findings demonstrate the existence of subtypes in MDD and may contribute to the future stratified medicine and intervention.\n\nMethods\nParticipants A total of 1,151 patients with MDD and 1,064 HC individuals from the REST-meta-MDD project10,26 (age 37.21 ± 14.64 years, 68% female for MDD; age 36.35 ± 15.53 years, 60% female for HC) were included as the discovery dataset. For two replication datasets, the strategic research programme for brain sciences of the DecNef Project from Japan (nMDD = 253, nHC = 585, age 42.49 ± 11.99, 47% female for MDD; age 39.69 ± 15.48 years, 55% female for HC27) and the Second Xiangya Hospital study (nMDD = 385, nHC = 502, age 23.20 ± 6.42 years, 68% female for MDD; age 21.45 ± 3.91 years, 64% female for HC) were also investigated. Based on the geographical location of the local hospitals, the participants’ ethnicity was identified (Chinese for the REST-meta-MDD project, Japanese for the Japan DecNef Project and Chinese for the Second Xiangya Hospital study). MDD patient diagnosis was confirmed by the structured clinical interview with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition. The self-reported ‘sex’ was used due to its biological attribution. All participants agreed to provide clinical diagnosis, age, sex and years of education. The demographic characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.\nEthical permission was approved by the medical research ethics committee (no. H19045 for the REST-meta-MDD project; Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (nos. 13–133, 14–133, 15–133, 16–133, 17–133 and 18–133), Hiroshima University (nos.

The trial registration number for this study is ChiCTR2000031931 (ref. 56).\nImage pre-processing and quality control Structural T1-weighted MRI brain scans were collected for each dataset. Using the voxel based morphometry (VBM) 8 toolbox57, the office of the REST-meta-MDD project conducted standard pre-processing as reported in previous studies10,58. Aligned with the REST-meta-MDD project, similar image pre-processing was conducted for the Japan DecNef Project and the Second Xiangya Hospital study, and briefly described as follows: we first segmented the structural T1-weighted MRI into grey matter, white matter and CSF using a unified segmentation routine59. We then employed the diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponential lie algebra tool60 to transform individual native space into standard Montreal Neurological Institute space with 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 mm3 resolution with an iterative registration. We modulated the grey matter maps to correct for volumetric distortions (based on the Jacobian of the spatially normalizing deformations), resulting in grey matter images.\nWe used the 2nd edition AAL-2 (ref. 61) template to parcellate the brain into 120 ROIs and the 3rd edition AAL-3 (ref. 62) to split the ACC into three ROIs (that is, subgenual ACC, pregenual ACC and supracallosal ACC). We further extracted each ROI by averaging the signals of all voxels included.\nUsing the R package flashClust, imaging outliers were identified if showing negative correlations with most of the rest of the individuals in terms of the whole-brain similarity and hence removed; for details, see Supplementary Figs. 10–12.\nFeature selection Due to the heavy computing resource demanding of the SuStaIn model23, we restricted the number of input ROIs below 20 (n <20), which contains brain cortical regions with the largest atrophy (that is,\n\nNature Mental Health\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-023-00139-4\n\nMDD versus HC: PFDR < 0.001 for each selected region, FDR corrected) in the REST-meta-MDD data, plus additional candidate ROIs (hippocampus and OFCs) following findings from the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis consortium11,13. As a result, 19 ROIs (Fig. 2b) were finally entered into the SuStaIn model to yield 57 sequenced events (that is, 19 ROIs multiplied by three severity thresholds, z = [1, 1.5, 2], gives a total of 57 stages). In the present study, we calculated the mean value of two ROIs from the left and right hemispheres.\n\nThe SuStaIn model\n\nPrevious investigations have explored the use of imaging biomark-\n\ners to identify subtype of MDD7,22, yet the relatively low replicability\n\nprevents us from using these characteristics. As a novel algorithm,\n\nthe SuStaIn model allows us to evaluate the neural atrophy subtype of\n\nMDD, which has exhibited excellent performance in identifying the\n\ndistinct ‘trajectories’ of Alzheimer’s disease24.\n\nConfounding factors such as the TIV, age, sex, years of education\n\nand site were first regressed out from ROIs for the REST-meta-MDD\n\nproject. The adjusted ROI that fed into the SuStaIn model was\n\nz-scored relative to the population of the HCs and was calculated as:\n\nYzscore\n\n=\n\n(−1)\n\n×\n\n, Yi −mean(X) std(X)\n\nwhere\n\nX denotes\n\nGMVs of HC\n\nindividuals\n\nand\n\nYi is the GMV of the ith patient with MDD. As a result, the higher z-value\n\nrepresents severe brain atrophy condition relative to HCs. Three\n\nz-scores (1, 1.5 and 2) were employed as cut-offs of MDD severity to\n\ndescribe the disease progression for the model.\n\nFor two replication datasets (that is, Japan DecNef Project and\n\nSecond Xiangya Hospital study), the TIV, age, sex and site were also\n\nregressed out from ROIs first. The adjusted ROIs were then fed into\n\nSuStaIn model with identical parameters and aligned with the discov-\n\nery dataset. Post hoc power analyses were conducted for the primary\n\nresults of this study using G*Power63; for details, see Supplementary\n\nTable 19.\n\nThe optimal number of MDD subtypes To identify the number of subtypes, as there is no consistent conclusion from previous studies7,64, we used the CVIC and out-of-sample log-likelihood23 to evaluate the performance. We employed a five-fold cross-validation of the SuStaIn data to determine the optimal number of subtypes, which was calculated with different cluster numbers from 1 to 5. Lower CVIC and higher log-likelihood represent better performance in the SuStaIn algorithm23. The three-cluster partition was the optimal choice, which showed the minimum CVIC (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and maximal log-likelihood (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Hence the optimal three-cluster separation indicated that there are three distinct GMV-based atrophy progressions in patients with MDD.\n\nThree distinct gene expressions of atrophy patterns The AHBA dataset (http://human.brain-map.org)65 was employed to investigate the gene expression of MDD subtypes, which is a wellknown brain transcriptomic dataset66,67. Only the left hemisphere from six samples was used in the present study. Following a previous paper by Arnatkeviciute et al.28, we implemented standard pre-processing of the AHBA dataset, including (1) the Re-annotator toolkit to identify the probe-to-gene annotations. (2) Intensity-based filtering and probe selection were performed. For each sample in the AHBA dataset, every probe has been assigned a binary indicator (that is, intensity-based filtering) to determine if it measures an expression signal surpassing the background levels28. To discriminate expression signal from noise, we used the intensity-based filtering28, which is based on a t-test criterion as outlined in the AHBA documentation68. After intensity-based filtering (that is, excluding probes that do not exceed the background noise threshold) and probe selection (that is, selecting microarray probes that have the highest correlation with the corresponding RNA-seq data), 10,027 genes were finally used in the present study28,66. (3) Samples were assigned within 2-mm Euclidean\n\ndistance of a parcel. For the sample brain region distance, we computed the distance by taking the minimum distance between the sample and any voxel in the region69–71, not by its centroid coordinate. This approach has been shown to be highly accurate for regions in any given parcellations irrespective of the size and folded geometry28. (4) We also conducted the scaled robust sigmoid normalization72 to control for heterogeneity due to donor difference. This approach normalizes gene expression based on the outlier–robust sigmoid function, which ensures equivalent scaling of expression values for each person in AHBA28.\nThe whole-brain analysis of GMV contrasting MDD and HC was then conducted to identify three MDD patterns (that is, whole-brain t-map). Finally, the statistical t-map was aligned to the transcriptomic data by the voxel-based coordinate of the MNI152 standard space. After standard pre-processing and intersection with the voxel-based brain template, we acquired a transcriptional matrix (1,397 locus × 10,027 gene expression).\nThe selection of MDD-related genes We investigated if previously reported MDD genes could also distinguish different atrophy-based subtypes. We chose previously defined MDD-related genes66 from the ‘Genes characterized by ISH in 1000 gene survey in cortex’ dataset provided by the AHBA68. The 12 MDD-related genes (that is, ‘ADRA2A’, ‘CHRM2’, ‘CNR1’, ‘CRH’, ‘CUX2’, ‘GAD2’, ‘HTR1A’, ‘HTR5A’, ‘MAOA’, ‘PDE1A’, ‘SST’ and ‘TAC1’; for details, see Supplementary Table 17) were included after the search with ‘depression’ in the ‘Gene List’ and intersection with 10,027 total genes from the AHBA.\nReporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe data of the AHBA microarray dataset are available from the website http://human.brain-map.org.

The sex was regressed out as a covariate in our analyses.\n\nPopulation characteristics\n\n1151 MDD patients and 1064 healthy control (HC) individuals from the REST-meta-MDD consortium(age 37.21 ± 14.64, 68% female for MDD; age 36.35 ± 15.53, 60% female for HC) were included as the discovery dataset. For two replication datasets, the Japan DecNef Project (nMDD = 253, nHC = 585, age 42.49 ± 11.99, 47% female for MDD; age 39.69 ± 15.48, 55% female for HC; “https://bicr.atr.jp/decnefpro/”) and the Second Xiangya Hospital study (nMDD = 385, nHC = 502, age 23.20 ± 6.42, 68% female for MDD; age 21.45 ± 3.91, 64% female for HC) were also investigated.\n\nRecruitment\n\nAll individuals were recruited from multiple sites\n\nEthics oversight\n\nEthical permission was approved by the medical research ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\nNote that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript.\n\nField-specific reporting\n\nPlease select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.\n\nLife sciences\n\nBehavioural & social sciences\n\nEcological, evolutionary & environmental sciences\n\nFor a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf\n\nLife sciences study design\n\nAll studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.\n\nSample size\n\nDue to the absence of a thorough exploration of comprehensive effect size or power calculation for SuStaIn, we determined the sample size based on prior SuStaIn investigations (Yuchao et al., 2023, Nature Mental Health; Young et al., 2018, Nature Communications; Vogel et al., 2021, Nature Medicine). These preceding studies suggested that approximately 30-40% of subjects would demonstrate measurable reductions in abnormal gray matter volume. Thus, it was imperative for us to analyze data from a minimum of 600 patients with MDD, and preferably exceeding 1000. We successfully achieved this objective.\n\nData exclusions\n\nOutliers (MDD outlier ratio = 125/1276 = 9.80%, HC outlier ratio = 37/1104 = 3.35% for the REST-meta-MDD consortium; MDD outlier ratio = 2/255 = 0.78%, HC outlier ratio = 13/598 = 2.17% for the Japan DecNef Project; MDD outlier ratio = 14/400 = 3.50%, HC outlier ratio = 3/505 = 0.59% for the Second Xiangya Hospital study) were identified if showing negative correlations with most of the rest of the individuals in terms of the whole brain structure patterns and hence removed.\n\nReplication\n\nTo cross-validate our findings, we then confirmed that our observed subtypes from our discovery data were robust across two independent datasets. The SuStaIn procedure with identical parameters was also conducted in two replication datasets from the Japan DecNef Project (253 patients with MDD, 585 healthy controls) and the Second Xiangya Hospital (385 patients with MDD, 502 healthy controls) respectively.\n\nRandomization\n\nThis is not relevant because we did not conduct a controlled trial. Instead, we merged individuals with MDD from different cohorts and employed a data-driven algorithm for subtyping. Subsequently, we performed comparisons of demographic and disease characteristics across these subtypes.\n\nBlinding\n\nBlinding was not relevant for experiments because the SuStaIn is a data-driven method without the need of demographic or clinical data. The individuals responsible for gathering demographic and clinical data were unaware of the SuStaIn subtyping outcomes. Likewise, those\n\n2\n\nMarch 2021\n\nresponsible for data preprocessing remained unaware of the demographic and clinical details. Thus, although the researchers were not personally blinded, the analysis itself remained effectively blinded.\n\nnature portfolio | reporting summary\n\nReporting for specific materials, systems and methods\nWe require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies.

Using the VBM 8 toolbox (http://dbm.neuro.unijena.de/vbm8/), the office of the REST-meta-MDD consortium conducted standard preprocessing as reported in previous studies. Aligned with the REST-meta-MDD consortium, similar image preprocessing was conducted for the Japan DecNef Project and the Second Xiangya Hospital study, and briefly described as follows: we first segmented the structural T1weighted MRI into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a unified segmentation routine (http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm). We then employed the diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponential lie (DARTEL) algebra tool to transform individual native space into standard montreal neurological institute (MNI) space with 1.5×1.5×1.5 mm resolution with an iterative registration. We modulated the gray matter maps by multiplying the linear and\n\n3\n\nMarch 2021\n\nnature portfolio | reporting summary\n\nNormalization Normalization template Noise and artifact removal Volume censoring\n\nnonlinear components of the Jacobian determinants, resulting in GM images.
