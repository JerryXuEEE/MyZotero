We discuss foundational issues such as what we mean by ‘computation’ and ‘information processing’ in nervous systems; whether computation and information processing are matters of objective fact or of conventional, observer-dependent description; and how computational descriptions and explanations are related to other levels of analysis and organization. \n \n    Previous article in issue \n    Next article in issue  \n \nCited by (27) \n \n    Ghosts in machine learning for cognitive neuroscience: Moving from data to theory \n    2018, NeuroImage \n    Show abstract \n    Editorial overview: Theoretical and computational neuroscience \n    2014, Current Opinion in Neurobiology \n    The Puzzling Resilience of Multiple Realization \n    2023, Minds and Machines \n    Interdisciplinarity in Cognitive Science and the Nature of Cognition \n    2023, Logic, Argumentation and Reasoning \n    Dynamical Systems Implementation of Intrinsic Sentence Meaning \n    2022, Minds and Machines \n    Cognition as Morphological/Morphogenetic Embodied Computation In Vivo \n    2022, Entropy \n \nView all citing articles on Scopus \nView full text \nCopyright © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. \nPart of special issue \nTheoretical and computational neuroscience \nEdited by \nAdrienne Fairhall , Haim Sompolinsky \nOther articles from this issue \n \n    The receptive field is dead.
