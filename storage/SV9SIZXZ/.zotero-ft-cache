Highlights

    •

    Neural systems process information by performing computations.
    •

    Neural computation and information processing operate at many levels of organization.
    •

    Computational neuroscience is an essential part of the science of cognition.

Most computational neuroscientists assume that nervous systems compute and process information . We discuss foundational issues such as what we mean by ‘computation’ and ‘information processing’ in nervous systems; whether computation and information processing are matters of objective fact or of conventional, observer-dependent description; and how computational descriptions and explanations are related to other levels of analysis and organization.
