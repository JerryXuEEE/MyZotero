across the membrane. A) For a cell that is permeable only to K+, the concentration gradient of K+ moves K+ ions out of the cell. B) The continued eﬄux of K+ builds up an excess of positive charge on the outside and negative charge on the inside. At equilibrium, the electrical and chemical driving forces are equal and opposite. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n2.2 Cartoon of the cell membrane showing the insulating lipid bilayer and a K+ channel which allows current to ﬂow.

These equations and the methods that arose from this combination of modeling and experiments have since formed the basis for every subsequent model for active cells. The Hodgkin-Huxley model and a host of simpliﬁed equations that are derived from them have inspired the development of new and beautiful mathematics. Dynamical systems and computational methods are now being used to study activity patterns in a variety of neuronal systems. It is becoming increasingly recognized, by both experimentalists and theoreticians, that issues raised in neuroscience and the mathematical analysis of neuronal models provides unique interdisciplinary collaborative research and educational opportunities.\nThis book is motivated by a perceived need for an overview of how dynamical systems and computational analysis have been used in understanding the types of models that come out of neuroscience. Our hope is that this will help to stimulate an increasing number of collaborations between mathematicians, looking for classes of interesting and relevant problems in applied mathematics and dynamical systems, and neuroscientists, looking for new ways to think about the biological mechanisms underlying experimentally observed ﬁring patterns.\nThe book arose out of several courses that the authors have taught. One of these is a graduate course in computational neuroscience that has students from psychology, mathematics, computer science, physics and neuroscience. Of course, teaching a course to students with such diverse backgrounds presents many challenges. However, the course provides many opportunities to encourage students, who may not normally interact with each other, to collaborate on exercises and projects. Throughout the book are many exercises that involve both computation and analysis. All of the exercises are motivated by issues that arise from the biology.\nWe have attempted to provide a comprehensive introduction to the vocabulary of neuroscience for mathematicians who are just getting interested in the ﬁeld but who have struggled with the biological details. Anyone who wants to work in computational neuroscience should learn these details as this is the only way one can be sure that the analysis and modeling is actually saying something useful to the biologists. We have also tried to provide background material on dynamical systems theory, including phase plane methods, oscillations, singular perturbations and bifurcation analysis. An excellent way to learn this material is by using it,\nxxv\n\ni i\n\nxxvi\n\nPreface\n\ntogether with computer simulations, to analyze interesting, concrete examples. The only prerequisite is a basic calculus course; however, it is very useful if students are comfortable with the basic theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations as well as linear algebra. Much of the mathematics is at the level of the book by Strogatz.\nThe book is organized from the bottom up. That is, we start with the biophysics of the cell membrane and from this introduce compartmental models, continuum limits and cable theory. We then add active ion channels. Prior to the work on active channels, all equations are linear and in theory completely solvable in closed form. Here we introduce a number of interesting approaches toward quantifying the responses of passive membranes to inputs. ...\nThere are several recent books that cover some of the same material in the present volume. Theoretical Neuroscience by Dayan and Abbott has a broader range of topics than our book. However, it does not go very deeply into the mathematical analysis of neurons and networks, nor does it emphasize the dynamical systems approach. A much closer book is Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience by Eugene Izhikevich. This book emphasizes the same approach as we take here. However, the main emphasis of DSN is in single neuron behavior. We cover a good deal of single neuron biophysics, but include a much larger proportion of theory on systems neuroscience and applications to networks.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\nChapter 1\n\ni i\n\nSome basic biology\nNeuroscience is the study of the brain. Brain function underlies all behavior including simple motor activity such as walking and smiling and higher order cognitive behavior such as thinking, learning and memory. The brain consists of neurons and glial cells. Neurons are the basic signaling units of the nervous system. The majority of this book is devoted to the mathematical analysis of models that describe the behavior of these cells. Glial cells are important in maintaining the health of neurons and how they behave and interact. Neurons communicate with each other at synapses. It has been estimated that there are approximately 1011 neurons and 1015 synapses in the human brain. Hence, neurons typically receive inputs from a very large number of other cells.\nIn the remainder of this chapter, we describe some basic properties of the brain, neurons and synapses. We will only touch on material that is absolutely essential for anyone interested in computational neuroscience. We highly recommend that the reader study this material in more detail by consulting one of the many excellent books devoted to neuroscience. Such books include Kandel/Schwartz/Jessell, Johnston/Wu, ... In fact, much of the following discussion is based on material from those books.\n1.1 The brain\nThe brain is highly organized both anatomically and functionally. The central nervous system (CNS) consists of two main parts: the spinal cord and the brain. The brain itself is partitioned in several areas. These are: the medulla oblongata, the pons, the cerebellum, the midbrain, the diencephalon, and cerebral hemispheres. Each of these consists of many parts or nuclei. For example, the diencephalon contains the thalamus and the hypothalamus. The cerebral hemispheres consist of the cerebral cortex and deep-lying structures that include the basal ganglia, the hippocampus and the amygdaloid nucleus. The cortex consists of four lobes; these are the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes.\nDiﬀerent brain structures are responsible for diﬀerent functions. For example,\n1\n\ni i\n\n2\n\nChapter 1. Some basic biology\n\nthe brainstem is responsible for maintaining many of the functions necessary for life such as breathing and heart rate. The basal ganglia participate in regulating motor performance and the thalamus processes most of the information reaching the cerebral cortex from the rest of the CNS. The cerebral cortex is the large region (large in mammals, notably humans, but nonexistent in many other vertebrates) that is directly beneath the skull. The cortex is responsible for our sensory, cognitive, and voluntary motor behaviors. The diﬀerent lobes of the cortex have specialized functions: the frontal lobe is largely concerned with the planning and organization of future actions; the occipital lobe is concerned with vision; the pariental lobe receives sensory information; and the temporal lobe is involved with hearing and other aspects of language and memory.\n\nFigure 1.1.\nWe note that each hemisphere is concerned primarily with sensory and motor processes on the contralateral side of the body. That is, sensory information that enters the spinal cord from the left side of the body crosses over to the right side of the nervous system, while motor areas in one hemisphere exert control over the movements of the opposite half of the body.\nCognitive and motor activities may be highly localized within the cerebral cortex. There are, in fact, sensory maps in which sensory information such as touch is organized topographically in the brain. Each part of the body is represented separately in a speciﬁc location in the somatosensory cortex. Sensitive regions, such as the ﬁngers and mouth, take up the most space. This is shown in Figure 1.2.\nAs one further example of how cognitive activities are localized within the brain, consider language. Diﬀerent aspects of language are processed in diﬀerent areas of the cortex. One area, called Wernicke’s area, is important to the understanding of spoken language, while another area, called Broca’s area, is concerned\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n1.2. The neuron\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.2.\nwith issuing speciﬁc commands that cause the mouth and tongue to form words. Hence, damage to Wernicke’s area makes it impossible for a person to understand speech, while damage to Broca’s area makes it impossible for a person to speak.\nWhile cognitive and motor activities are localized within the brain, it is important to realize that complex mental activities, such as learning or memory, typically involve interconnections between many brain regions. We have seen, for example, that language involves both Wernicke’s and Broca’s area, which lie in diﬀerent parts of the left cerebral hemisphere. Interrelated mental activities are processed by many neural pathways that are distributed in parallel. For this reason, damage to one single area often does not necessarily lead to the loss of a speciﬁc function.\n1.2 The neuron\nNeurons are specialized cells that like all other cells contain the usual organelles necessary for staying alive. These include the mitochondria, responsible for fueling the cells, and the nucleus, which holds the genetic material that gets passed on when the cell divides.\nThe structure of a neuron can be divided into three parts: (i) the dendrites; (ii) the soma; and (iii) the axon. The soma or cell body is the site of the nucleus and all the normal cellular machinery. Functionally the soma plays the role of integrating all of the inputs of the cell to produce some output. The dendrites and axon are processes that emanate from the soma. Neurons usually have several dendrites; these form the “input lines” of the cell. The dendrites often branch out\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n4\n\nChapter 1. Some basic biology\n\nin a tree-like fashion that can be very large. In many cases, the majority of the surface area of the cell is taken up by the dendrites. Neurons usually have some sort of general orientation. Dendrites that lie at the top of the neuron are called apical dendrites and those that lie at the base are called basal dendrites. Figure 1.2 shows the variety of possible shapes that neurons can take; the main diﬀerences are in the shapes of the dendritic trees. Although neurons share many common features, it has been estimated that there are as many as 10,000 diﬀerent types.\n\nFigure 1.3.\nThe axon typically leaves the soma as a single thin process but then branches out in order to connect to other cells. The diameter of an axon may range from .2 to 20 µm and may extend for up to one meter. The axon is the major conducting unit of the neuron; it can convey information great distances by propagating a transient electrical signal called the action potential. The action potential is initiated at a specialized region of the soma called the axon hillock. Large axons are surrounded by a fatty insulating sheath called myelin. This is essential for high-speed conduction of action potentials. The sheath is interrupted at regular intervals by nodes of Ranvier.\nThe action potential represents a change in the neuron’s membrane potential. Neurons, like all other cells, maintain a potential diﬀerence of about 65 mV across their external membrane. What distinguishes neurons and other excitable cells from most cells in the body is that this resting membrane potential can be altered and can, therefore, serve as a signaling mechanism. The action potential corresponds to a change in resting potential that propagates along the axon. The action potential is initiated when the membrane potential at the axon hillock reaches some threshold potential; once this threshold is reached, the signal propagates in a all-or-none fashion. That is, the amplitude and duration of the signal is always the same no matter how it is generated. Action potentials may last as short as 1 ms and\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n1.3. The synapse\n\n5\n\nmay travel at rates that vary between about 1 and 100 meters per second. After each action potential, there is a period during which a second impulse cannot be initiated. The is referred to as the refractory period.\nStronger stimuli often produce higher frequencies of impulse ﬁring. Since the shape and speed of each action potential does not depend on the stimulus, information about the stimulus is often carried in the frequency of ﬁring. The frequency is limited by the refractory period. Some neurons are capable of continuously generating action potentials, even without inputs. The temporal pattern of ﬁring may be quite complicated. A neuron may generate a single spike in a periodic fashion, or may generates bursting activity in which there are episodes of high frequency ﬁring separated by periods of quiescent behavior. More complicated ﬁring patterns are possible and these will be described later in the text.\nIn the following sections, we shall give much more details of the mechanisms underlying the generation of action potentials. This, in turn, will lead to the famous Hodgkin-Huxley model for the propagation of action potentials along the nerve axon.\n\nV\n20 0\n−20 −40 −60\n0 C\n\n10mV\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\ngton=.6\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n4 sec\n\nFigure 1.4.\n1.3 The synapse\nNeurons communicate with each other at synapses. The cell that is sending the signal is called the presynaptic neuron and the cell that is receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron. Synapses can be either electrical or chemical. In electrical synapses, there is a direct connection from one neuron to another by way of a channel or gap junction. This type of synapse is rare among the principal cell types in the mammalian brain; for this reason, we will concentrate primarily on chemical synapses.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n6\n\nChapter 1. Some basic biology\n\nIn chemical synaptic signaling, there is a space, called the synaptic cleft, separating the presynaptic from the postsynaptic cell. Most presynaptic neurons terminate near the dendrites of the postsynaptic cell; however, communication may occur with the cell body or, less often, with portions of the axon.\nSignals from the presynaptic neurons result in the release of chemicals, called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters diﬀuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell causing changes in the membrane potential. The membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell may either increase or decrease relative to its resting potential. This depends on the nature of the neurotransmitter and the type of receptor it binds to. A reduction of membrane potential (that is, the inside of the cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside) is called depolarization and the synapse is said to be excitatory. An increase of membrane potential (the inside becomes more negative) is called hyperpolarization. In this case, the synapse is said to be inhibitory.\n\nFigure 1.5.\nWe have seen that chemical synapses can be either excitatory or inhibitory. They can also be classiﬁed as direct or indirect. In a direct synapse, the postsynaptic receptor contains both the transmitter binding site and the ion channel opened by the transmitter as part of the same receptor. In an indirect synapse, the transmitter binds to receptors that are not themselves ion channels. Direct synapses are typically much faster than indirect synapses. In fact, direct synapses are often referred to as fast synapses, while indirect synapses are referred to as slow synapses.\nElectrical synapses have the advantage that they are fast; there is not the time delay associated with chemical synapses. However, chemical synapses, which are much more abundant in the human brain, have many advantages. They are able to\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n1.3. The synapse\n\n7\n\namplify signals; a single action potential from the postsynaptic cell may result in a much more powerful, longer lasting response in the postsynaptic cell. Moreover, indirect synapses can be modiﬁed, through a process called neuromodulation, so that the eﬃcacy of the synaptic response may change (through learning, for example).\nThe architecture of synaptic connections may be quite complicated. Each neuron in the human brain receives, on average, inputs from about 10000 other neurons. Neurons may communicate with other cells close by, while neurons with long axons may make synapses up to a meter away. Synaptic communication need not be in one direction; that is, neurons may make reciprocal synapses onto their presynaptic cells. Since most neurons have similar electrical properties, diﬀerent functions carried out by diﬀerent parts of the brain may be due to diﬀerences in the synaptic connections.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n8\n\nChapter 1. Some basic biology\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\nChapter 2\nThe Hodgkin-Huxley equations\n2.1 The resting potential\nAll living cells have an electrical voltage, or potential diﬀerence, between their inside and outside. Since the cell’s membrane is what separates the inside from the outside, this potential diﬀerence is referred to as the membrane potential. In mathematical terms, the membrane potential VM is deﬁned as\nVM = Vin − Vout\nwhere Vin is the potential on the inside of the cell and Vout is the potential on the outside. This will change during an action potential, for example.\nThe resting potential refers to the potential across the membrane when the cell is at rest. A typical neuron has a resting potential of about -70 millivolts. An inward current corresponds to a positively charged ion, such as Na+, entering the cell. This raises the membrane potential; that is, it brings the membrane potential closer to zero. In this case, the cell is said to be depolarized. An outward current corresponds to a positively charged ion, such as K+, leaving the cell or a negatively charged ion, such as Cl−, entering the cell. In this case, the cell becomes hyperpolarized.\nThe potential diﬀerence arises from diﬀerences in the concentrations of various ions within and outside the cell. The maintenance of the potential diﬀerence also involves the transport of ions across the cell membrane and the selective permeability of the membrane to these ions. The principal ions found on either side of the cell membrane are Na+, K+, and Cl−. The concentration of K+ ions inside a cell is about 10 times that in the extracellular ﬂuid, whereas the concentrations of Na+ and Cl− are much higher outside the cell than inside.\nThe lipid bilayer of the cell membrane is a poor conductor of ionic current because it is not permeable to ions. However, the membrane does contain channel proteins that allow for the ions to move through it. There are two types of ion channels in the membrane: gated and nongated. Nongated channels are always open, while gated channels can open and close and the probability of opening often depends on the membrane potential; these are referred to as voltage-gated chan-\n9\n\ni i\n\n10\n\nChapter 2. The Hodgkin-Huxley equations\n\nnels. Gated channels are typically selective to a single ion. The permeability of the\nmembrane to a particular ion depends on the number of open channels selective to\nthat ion. Most gated channels are closed at rest. Hence, the nongated ion channels are primarily responsible for establishing the resting potential. An action potential\nis generated when gated channels open allowing for the ﬂux of ions across the cell membrane.\nBecause of concentration diﬀerences, when the appropriate channels are open,\nsodium and chloride ions tend to diﬀuse into the cell, while potassium ions tend to diﬀuse outwards. Note that ions do not simply diﬀuse in or out of an open channel\nuntil the concentrations of that ion on either side of the cell is zero. This is because\nof the electric ﬁeld created by separation of positive and negative charges across the cell membrane.\nSuppose, for example, that the cell is permeable only to K+. The concentration gradient of K+ moves K+ ions out of the cell. However, the continued eﬄux of K+ builds up an excess of positive charge on the outside of the cell and leaves behind\nan excess of negative charge on the inside. The negative charge consists mostly of impermeable organic anions A−. This buildup of charge acts to impede the further eﬄux of K+, so that eventually an equilibrium is reached. At this equilibrium,\nthe electrical and chemical driving forces are equal and opposite. The membrane potential at which K+ ions are in equilibrium across the membrane is called the K+\nNernst, equilibrium or reversal potential.\n\nA)\nCl -\n\nNa+\n\nNa+\n\nNa+ K+\n\nExtracellular side\n\nB)\n\nCl -\n\nCl -\n\nNa+\n\nK+\n\nNa+\n\nNa+\n\nNa+\n\n++++++\n\nCl -\n\nK+\n\nNa+\n\n++++++\n\nCytoplasmic side\nAA-\nK+\n\nK+\n\nK+\n\nA-\n\nA-\nK+\n\n-----A- A-\n\n------\n\nK+\n\nA-\n\nK+\n\nA-\n\nK+\n\nFigure 2.1. The K+ ﬂux is determined by both the K+ concentration\ngradient and the electrical potential across the membrane. A) For a cell that is permeable only to K+, the concentration gradient of K+ moves K+ ions out of the cell. B) The continued eﬄux of K+ builds up an excess of positive charge on the\noutside and negative charge on the inside. At equilibrium, the electrical and chemical\ndriving forces are equal and opposite.\n\nIn the next section, we shall derive the following expression for the K+ Nernst\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n2.2. The Nernst equation\n\n11\n\npotential:\n\nEK\n\n=\n\nRT zF\n\nln\n\n[K + ]out [K +]in\n\n.\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere, EK is the K+ Nernst potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin, z is the valence of K+, F is Faraday constant and [K+]out and [K+]in are the concentrations of K+ ions outside and inside of the cell. A similar formula holds for the Na+ and Cl− Nernst potentials.\nNeurons at rest are permeable to Na+ and Cl− in addition to K+. Because of their concentration diﬀerences, Na+ and Cl− ions move into the cell and K+ ions move outwards. The inﬂux of Na+ ions tends to depolarize the cell, while the eﬄux of K+ and the inﬂux of Cl− have the opposite eﬀect. The resting potential of the\ncell is the potential at which there is a balance between these ﬂuxes. It depends\non the concentrations of the ions both inside and outside of the cell, as well as the\npermeability of the cell membrane to each of the ions. We note that at rest, there are many more K+ and Cl− channels than Na+ that are open. Hence, the cell’s resting potential is determined primarily by the K+ and Cl− Nernst potentials. In the\nfollowing sections, we shall derive the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, which gives\nan explicit expression for how the resting potential depends on the concentrations,\nboth inside and outside, of ions and the permeabilities of the membrane to the ions. In order for a cell to maintain a constant resting potential, the eﬄux of K+\nions must balance the inﬂux of Na+ ions. (Here we are ignoring Cl− ions.) That\nis, the charge separation across the membrane must be constant. If these steady\nion leaks continue unopposed, then potassium ions within the cell would become\ndepleted, while the concentration of sodium ions inside the cell would increase. This\nwould eventually result in a loss of the ionic gradients, necessary for maintaining the\nresting potential. The dissipation of ionic gradients is prevented by active pumps the extrudes Na+ ions from the cell while taking in K+. The Na+-K+ pump is an integral membrane protein that exchanges three Na+ ions for two K+ ions. This\nis probably the most important ion transporter in biological membranes; however,\nthere are many other proteins in the membrane that are capable of pumping ions\nfrom one side of the membrane to the other.\n\n2.2 The Nernst equation\nHere we derive the Nernst equation and in the next section, we derive the GoldmanHodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation. Recall that if the membrane is permeable to only one ion, then that ion’s Nernst potential is the resting potential at which the electrical and chemical driving forces balance. The GHK equation is, in some sense, a generalization of the Nernst equation in which we assume that the membrane is permeable to more than just one ion. The GHK equation determines the resting potential at which the electrical and chemical forces, generated by each of these ions, balance with each other. The ﬁrst step in deriving these equations is to derive the Nernst-Plank equation.\nIn what follows, let [C](x) be the concentration of some ion and V (x) be the potential at the point x across the membrane. Then Fick’s law of diﬀusion says\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n12\n\nChapter 2. The Hodgkin-Huxley equations\n\nthat the diﬀusive ﬂux, Jdiff , is given by:\n\nJdif f\n\n=\n\n−D\n\n∂[C] ∂x\n\n.\n\nThe diﬀusion constant, D has units of cm2/sec and the concentration is in molecules per cubic centimeter so that the diﬀusive ﬂux has units of molecules/sec-cm2. (Think of the ﬂux as movement across the two-dimensional cell surface.) The direction of movement is from high concentrations to low concentrations. The diﬀusion constant (empirically measured) depends on the size of the molecule and the medium in which it is diﬀusing. A typical value for ions like potassium, chloride, and sodium is 2.5 × 10−6cm2/sec. Calcium has a diﬀusion constant about an order of magnitude less.\nThe other physical force that is responsible for the passive movement of ions is the electrical drift described by the microscopic version of Ohm’s law:\n\nJdrif t\n\n=\n\n−µz[C]\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n.\n\nThe\n\nelectric\n\nﬁeld,\n\nE\n\n≡\n\n−\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n,\n\nis\n\nthe\n\ngradient\n\nof\n\nthe\n\npotential\n\nV\n\n(measured in volts)\n\nand thus has units of volt/cm. z is the valence of the ion (±1, ±2, etc). The param-\n\neter µ is mobility and has dimensions of cm2/V-sec and [C] is the concentration.\n\nThe higher the concentration, the greater the drift. Note that drift has the same\n\ndimensions as the diﬀusive ﬂux.\n\nThe total ﬂux across the membrane is given by the sum of these two:\n\nJtotal\n\n=\n\n−D\n\n∂[C ∂x\n\n]\n\n−\n\nµz[C\n\n]\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n.\n\nEinstein’s relation connects the mobility with the diﬀusion coeﬃcient:\n\nD\n\n=\n\nkT q\n\nµ\n\nwhere k is Boltzmann’s constant (joule/◦K), T is the absolute temperature, and q is the charge (measured in coulombs). Thus, we can write the total ﬂux as:\n\nJtotal\n\n=\n\n−\n\nµkT q\n\n∂[C] ∂x\n\n−\n\nµz[C]\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n.\n\nIt is convenient to convert this equation, which is in terms of the number of individual molecules into its molar equivalent, by dividing by Avogadro’s number. It is also convenient to replace kT /q with RT /F where R is the ideal gas constant and F is the Faraday constant. (A list of these constants is given at the end of this section.) This will yield the ﬂux per mole. Multiplying this ﬂux by the valence and Faraday’s constant yields a current ﬂux:\n\nI =−\n\nuzRT\n\n∂[C] ∂x\n\n+\n\nuz2F\n\n[C]\n\n∂V ∂x\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n2.3. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation\n\n13\n\nmeasured in amperes/cm2. The quantity u is the molar mobility, µ/NA. This equation is the Nernst-Planck Equation.\nThe Nernst equation is obtained by setting the current to zero. That is, for a given ion species, at equilibrium, the diﬀusion and electric eﬀects balance:\n\nI =−\n\nuzRT\n\n∂[C] ∂x\n\n+\n\nuz\n\n2F\n\n[C\n\n]\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n= 0.\n\nAs an exercise, it is left to the reader to prove that this implies the Nernst equation:\n\nVeq\n\n≡\n\nVin\n\n− Vout\n\n=\n\n−\n\nRT zF\n\nln\n\n[C ]in [C ]out\n\n.\n\n(2.2)\n\nThat is, the equilibrium, or Nernst, potential, occurring when all the ﬂuxes balance, depends on the logarithm of the ratio of the concentrations of the ions inside and outside of the cell.\nTo illustrate how to use the Nernst equation to compute an equilibrium potential, note that in a typical mammalian cell, there is 140 mM of potassium inside the cell and 5 mM outside. At room temperature 37◦C, RT /F = 62 mV. This means the equilibrium potential of potassium is\n\n−62\n\nlog\n\n140 5\n\n=\n\n−89.7mV.\n\nAs above, we will leave the details of this calculation the reader.\n\n2.3 The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation\nThe Nernst-Planck equation describes the movement of charged ions in aqueous media. However, the cell membrane has thickness and there may be energy barriers or blocking sites within the channel. In this case, the ions ﬂowing through the open channel may not obey the Nernst-Planck equation and we must model the complex behavior within this membrane to get a true picture of the ﬂux across the cell. This type of biophysics is beyond the details that are needed for this book, but the resulting equation does play a role in later parts. Thus, we will present a shortened derivation of a simpliﬁcation of what happens within the membrane. Goldman, Hodgkin, and Katz came up with this simpliﬁed model called the constant ﬁeld equation (CFE). They assume that (i) the electric ﬁeld across the lipid membrane is constant, (ii) the Nernst-Planck equation holds within the membrane, and (iii) the ions all move independently.\nLet VM be the total potential across a membrane of width l and let V (x) be the potential at the point x across the membrane. Since the electric ﬁeld is constant, E = −VM /l. This implies that dV /dx = VM /l. The mobility of ions within the membrane will be diﬀerent than in the aqueous solution; denote this mobility by u∗. Finally, let β be the ratio of the ion solubility within the membrane to the solubility in the aqueous solution. Thus, if [C] is the aqueous concentration, then β[C] is the membrane concentration. With these assumptions the Nernst-Planck\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n14\n\nChapter 2. The Hodgkin-Huxley equations\n\nequation for current across the membrane is:\n\nI\n\n=\n\n−u∗z2F\n\nβ[C]\n\nVM l\n\n−\n\nu∗z\n\nRT\n\nβ\n\nd[C dx\n\n]\n\n,\n\n0 < x < l.\n\nThis is just a ﬁrst order linear ordinary diﬀerential equation for [C] subject to the two boundary conditions\n\n[C](0) = [C]in, [C](l) = [C]out.\n\nOne cannot, in general, solve a ﬁrst order equation with two boundary conditions. However, the current I is unknown, so that choosing this correctly will allow us to ﬁnd a solution that satisﬁes both boundary conditions. We leave this elementary exercise to the reader. The result is:\n\nI\n\n=\n\nu∗z2F VM β l\n\n[C]oute−ξ − [C]in e−ξ − 1\n\nwhere\n\nξ\n\n=\n\nzVM F RT\n\n.\n\nThis expression is often written in terms of the permeability,\n\nP\n\n≡\n\nβu∗RT lF\n\n;\n\nthat is,\n\nI = PzFξ\n\n[C]oute−ξ − [C]in e−ξ − 1\n\n.\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe permeability has dimensions of cm/sec. Thus, the dimensions are in terms of current per unit area.\nThis is the current due to a single ionic species. The current vanishes at the equilibrium or Nernst potential of the ionic species. A common quantity to plot is the current-voltage (I − V ) plot. If the inside and outside concentrations are identical, then the I − V plot is linear. For [C]out > [C]in (resp. [C]out < [C]in ) the I − V plot is concave down (resp. concave up). The reader is encouraged to plot the current as a function of the voltage for diﬀerent concentration ratios. If the concentrations are quite diﬀerent on the inside and outside, then the I − V curve is strongly rectifying. That means that the magnitude of the current depends strongly on whether or not the potential is above or below the equilibrium.\nGiven several ionic species, the total current is just a sum of the individual currents. This is a consequence of assumption (iii) which says that the ions do not interact. Suppose that there are three permeant ions: K+, N a+ and Cl− with corresponding currents, IK , INa and ICl. At equilibrium the total current, I = IK + INa + ICl vanishes; that is, I = 0. The potential at which this occurs is:\n\nVM\n\n=\n\nRT F\n\nln\n\nPK [K+]out + PNa[N a+]out + PCl[Cl−]in PK [K+]in + PNa[N a+]in + PCl[Cl−]out\n\n(2.4)\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n2.3.

This is a generalization of the Nernst equilibrium discussed above and is called the GoldmanHodgkin-Katz equation (GHK). With one species, the equation reduces to the Nernst potential. For example, in the squid axon, the ratios of the permeabilities, at rest, are PK : PNa : PCl = 1 : 0.03 : 0.1. The ion concentrations inside the cell are, respectively, for K, N a and Cl, 400 mM, 50 mM, and 40 mM; while outside the cell they are 10 mM, 460 mM, and 540 mM. Thus, at room temperature, the equilibrium or resting potential is -70 mV.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n16\n\nChapter 2. The Hodgkin-Huxley equations\n\nTable 2.2.

Currents ﬂow\n\naccording to the permeabilities of ion channels and concentration gradients across\n\nthe cell membrane. However, all of our discussion so far has been in a steady-state\n\nenvironment. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation does not determine how the\n\nmembrane potential changes in response to changes in the permeabilities. For this\n\nreason, it cannot be used to understand how these changes in permeabilities may\n\ngenerate an action potential. A very useful way to describe the behavior of the\n\nmembrane potential is in terms of electrical circuits; this is commonly called the\n\nequivalent circuit model. The circuit consists of three components: (1) conductors\n\nor resistors, representing the ion channels; (2) batteries, representing the concen-\n\ntration gradients of the ions; and (3) capacitors, representing the ability of the\n\nmembrane to store charge. The equivalent circuit model leads to both an intuitive\n\nand quantitative understanding of how the movement of ions generate electrical\n\nsignals in the nerve cell.\n\nWe ﬁrst consider a membrane that is only permeable to potassium. The\n\nequivalent circuit is shown in Figure 2.2. The lipid bilayer that comprises the cell\n\nmembrane has dielectric properties and as such behaves in much the same manner\n\nas a capacitor. Recall that capacitors store charge and then release it in the form\n\nof currents. The relationship between the charge stored and the potential is given\n\nby:\n\nq = CM VM ;\n\n(2.5)\n\nthat is, the total charge q is proportional to the potential VM with a proportionality constant CM called the membrane capacitance. Note that the total capacitance depends on the total area of the dielectric; thus larger neurons have a larger to-\ntal capacitance than smaller ones. The capacitance per square centimeter is called the speciﬁc membrane capacitance and will be denoted as cM . Hence, the total membrane capacitance CM is the membrane speciﬁc capacitance cM times the total surface area of the cell. In general, the speciﬁc membrane capacitance may depend on the potential; however, for most cell membranes, the speciﬁc membrane capacitance is very close to 1 µ F/cm2.\nSince current is the time derivative of charge, we can diﬀerentiate (2.5) and obtain an expression for the speciﬁc capacitance current:\n\nicap\n\n=\n\ncM\n\ndVM dt\n\n.\n\n(2.6)\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n18\n\nChapter 2.

The equivalent electrical\ncircuit is shown on the right\n\nThis gives the capacitance current per unit area. We will denote the total capaci-\ntance current as Icap. In the equivalent circuit, K+ channels are represented as a conductor in series\nwith a battery. If gˆK is the conductance of a single K+ channel, then, using Ohm’s law, the ionic current through this channel is\n\nIˆK = gˆK(VM − EK ).\n\n(2.7)\n\nHere EK is the potential generated by the battery; this is given by the K+ Nernst potential. The driving force is VM − EK . Now suppose there are NK potassium channels in a unit area of membrane. These can all be combined into the single\nequivalent circuit shown in Figure 2.2. The conductance per unit area, or speciﬁc membrane conductance (S/cm2) is given by gK = NK × gˆK and the speciﬁc membrane resistance (Ω-cm2) is rK ≡ 1/gK. Since the Nernst potential depends only on the concentration gradient of K+, and not on the number of K+ channels, it follows that the K+ current, per unit area, is given by\n\nIK\n\n=\n\ngK (VM − EK )\n\n=\n\nVM\n\n− rK\n\nEK\n\n.\n\n(2.8)\n\nKirchhoﬀ’s current law states that the total current into the cell must sum to zero. Together with the equivalent circuit representation, this leads to a diﬀerential equation for the membrane potential:\n\n0=\n\nicap + IK\n\n=\n\ncM\n\ndVM dt\n\n+\n\nVM − EK rK\n\n(2.9)\n\nor\n\ncM\n\ndVM dt\n\n=\n\n− VM − EK rK\n\n=\n\n− gK (VM − EK ).\n\n(2.10)\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n2.5. Equivalent circuits: the electrical analogue\n\n19\n\nFigure 2.3 shows an equivalent circuit with three parallel conductances and a current source, I(t). Here the capacitance current must be equal to the sum of the ionic currents and the current source. As before, the capacitance current, per unit area, is given by (2.6) and the ionic current, per unit area, is given by\n\niion = gCl(VM − ECl) − gK(VM − EK ) − gNa(VM − ENa).\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe current source is not typically expressed as current per unit area, so we must divide I(t) by the total surface area of the neuron, A. It then follows that\n\ncM\n\ndVM dt\n\n= −gCl(VM − ECl) − gK (VM − EK ) − gNa(VM − ENa) + I(t)/A.\n\n(2.12)\n\nNote that we can rewrite this equation as\n\ncM\n\ndVM dt\n\n=\n\n−\n\n(VM − rM\n\nER)\n\n+\n\nI (t)/A\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere\n\nER = gClECl + gK EK + gNaENa\n\nis the cell’s resting potential and\n\nrM\n\n=\n\ngCl\n\n1 + gK\n\n+ gNa\n\nis the speciﬁc membrane resistance. For a passive membrane in which the conductances and currents are all con-\nstant, then VM will reach a steady state:\n\nVss\n\n=\n\ngClECl + gK EK + gNaENa gCl + gk + gNa\n\n+ I/A .\n\nIn absence of the applied current, the steady state potential is a weighted sum of the equilibrium potentials of the three currents. This is similar to the GoldmanHodgkin-Katz equation (2.4) in which the contribution to the resting potential by each ion is weighted in proportion to the permeability of the membrane for that particular ion. Note, however, that in the equivalent circuit model, the equilibrium is a linear weighted sum of the equilibrium potentials, while in the GHK equation, the sum is nonlinear.\nWe remark that membrane conductance and permeability are related concepts; however, they are not the same. The permeability depends on the state of the membrane, while conductance depends on both the state of the membrane and the concentration of the ions. The permeability to K+, for example, may be high if there are a large number of open K+ channels. However, if the concentration of K+ ions is low on both sides of the membrane, then the K+ conductance would be low.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n20\n\nChapter 2.

Equivalent circuit for a membrane with three channels.\n\n2.6 The membrane time constant\nIn this section, we consider how a passive, isopotential cell responds to an applied current. This will help explain how each component of the electrical circuit contributes to changes in the membrane potential. The cell is said to be passive if its electrical properties do not change during signaling. Such a cell cannot generate an action potential; however, it is important to understand how a cell’s passive, or constant, properties inﬂuence changes in the membrane potential before considering active signaling. Moreover, many dendrites do not have gated channels so their behavior is inﬂuenced primarily by their passive properties. The cell is said to be isopotential if the membrane potential is uniform at all points of the cell; that is, the membrane potential depends only on time. To simplify the analysis, we will consider a spherical cell with radius ρ.\nSuppose that this cell is injected with an applied current, I(t), that is turned on at t = 0 to some constant value, I0, and turned oﬀ at t = T . Here, we assume that I0 > 0; however, this is really not necessary. Note that for an isopotential cell, the injected current distributes uniformly across the surface. It follows that for a spherical cell, the current ﬂowing across a unit area of the membrane is\n\n I0\n\nIM (t)\n\n=\n\nI (t) 4πρ2\n\n=\n\n \n\n4πρ2\n0\n\nif 0 < t < T otherwise\n\n(2.14)\n\nAs before, suppose that cM is the speciﬁc membrane capacitance, rM is the\n\nspeciﬁc membrane resistance and ER is the cell’s resting potential. To simplify things, we take ER = 0 so that VM measures deviation of the membrane potential\n\nfrom rest.

Once the current is turned on, the membrane potential asymptotically approaches the steady state value rM I0/(4πρ2). The approach is exponential with the time constant τM . The membrane time constant also determines the rate at which the membrane potential decays back to rest after\nthe current is turned oﬀ. The steady state membrane potential satisﬁes\n\nI0\n\nrM 4πρ2\n\n≡ I0RINP\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere RINP is the input resistance of the cell. Note that if the input current changes by ∆I, then the steady state membrane potential changes by RINP × ∆I; that is, the input resistance is the slope of the I − V curve obtained by plotting the steady state voltage against the injected current.\nThe initial rise in membrane potential is determined primarily by the membrane capacitance. Initially the voltage across the resistor and capacitor are both equal to 0. From Ohm’s law, it follows that initially no current ﬂows through the resistor and all the current is due to the capacitor. Because of the capacitive current, the potential across the capacitor and hence the membrane potential, will become more positive. As VM increases, the membrane potential diﬀerence begins to drive current across the membrane resistance resulting in less current across the capacitor. Eventually, the membrane potential reaches a value where all the membrane current ﬂows through the resistor. This value is given by VM = I0RINP .\nFigure 2.4 also shows responses in which there are purely resistive or purely capacitive elements. If there is no membrane capacitance, then VM satisﬁes\n\nVM (t) = rM IM (t).\n\n(2.19)\n\nThat is, VM jumps to the steady state potential, RINP I0, as soon as the injected current is turned on and it jumps back to rest as soon as the current is turned oﬀ. If there is only a capacitive element, then the membrane potential changes linearly as long as there is an applied current.\n\n2.7 The cable equation\nWe have, so far, considered the passive properties of an isopotential cell. This analysis may be used to describe signaling within the cell body, which can be approximated by a sphere. However, it is clearly not appropriate for studying electrical properties of the axon or dendrites. These are better approximated by cylinders that are not isopotential.

The bottom panel shows the time course of the total membrane current, the ionic current and the capacitive current.\npoint along the axon or dendrite will decrease in amplitude with distance from the point of initiation. It is important to understand how the geometry of the cell affects the spread of the signal. The signal may, for example, correspond to synaptic input from another neuron. Understanding how geometry aﬀects the spread of the signal will help determine whether the synaptic input will cause the cell to ﬁre an action potential. Here we assume that the membrane is passive, so the analysis is more applicable to dendrites than to axons. However, as we shall describe later, the passive spread of current ﬂow helps determine the velocity of propagating action potentials in the axon.\nWe consider a cell that is shaped as a long cylinder, or cable, of radius a. We assume that the current ﬂow is along a single spatial dimension, x, the distance along the cable. In particular, membrane potential depends only on the x-variable, not on the radial or angular components. The cable equation is a partial diﬀerential equation that describes how the membrane potential VM (x, t) depends on currents entering, leaving and ﬂowing within the neuron. The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 2.5 where Ilong is the current along the inside of the cable, IM is the current across the membrane, RL is the resistance of the cytoplasm, Re is the resistance of the extracellular space, RM is the membrane resistance and CM is the membrane capacitance. In what follows, we will assume that Re = 0, so that the extracellular\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n2.7. The cable equation\n\n23\n\nspace is isopotential. This assumption is justiﬁed if the cable is in a bath with large cross-sectional area.\n\nRe\n\nRM CM\n\nIM\n\na\n\nIlong\n\nRL\n\nx\n\nFigure 2.5. Equivalent circuit for a uniform passive cable.\n\nWe ﬁrst consider the axial current ﬂowing along the neuron due to voltage\ngradients. Note that the total resistance of the cytoplasm grows in proportion to the length of the cable and is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the\ncable. The speciﬁc intracellular resistivity, which we denote as rL, is the constant of proportionality. Hence, a cable of radius a and length ∆x has a total resistance of RL = rL∆x/(πa2) It follows from Ohm’s law that at any point x, the decrease in VM with distance is equal to the current times the resistance. That is,\n\nVM (x\n\n+\n\n∆x,\n\nt)\n\n−\n\nVM\n\n(x,\n\nt)\n\n=\n\n−Ilong (x,\n\nt)RL\n\n=\n\n−Ilong (x,\n\nt)\n\n∆x πa2\n\nrL.\n\n(2.20)\n\nThere is a minus sign because of the convention that positive current is a ﬂow of positive charges from left to right.

Then the total ionic current that ﬂows across a membrane of radius a and length ∆x is given by Iion = (2πa∆x)iion.\nRecall that the rate of change of the membrane potential is determined by the capacitance. The total capacitance of a membrane is equal to the speciﬁc\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n24\n\nChapter 2. The Hodgkin-Huxley equations\n\nmembrance capacitance cM multiplied by the total surface area of the membrane. Hence, for a cable of radius a and length ∆x, the total capacitance is given by\nCM = (2πa∆x)cM and the amount of current needed to change the membrane potential at a rate ∂VM /∂t is\n\nIcap\n\n=\n\n(2πa∆x)cM\n\n∂VM ∂t\n\n.\n\n(2.22)\n\nFrom Kirchhoﬀ’s law, the change in intracellular axial current is equal to the amount of current that ﬂows across the membrane. Hence,\n\nIcap(x, t) + Iion(x, t) = Ilong(x + ∆x, t) − Ilong(x, t)\n\n(2.23)\n\nfrom it which it follows that\n\n(2πa∆x)cM\n\n∂VM ∂t\n\n+ (2πa∆x)iion\n\n=\n\nπa2 rL\n\n∂VM ∂x\n\n(x\n\n+\n\n∆x,\n\nt)\n\n−\n\nπa2 rL\n\n∂VM ∂x\n\n(x,\n\nt)\n\nWe divide both sides of this equation by 2πa∆x and let ∆x → 0 to obtain the cable equation:\n\ncM\n\n∂VM ∂t\n\n=\n\na ∂2VM 2rL ∂x2\n\n− iion\n\n(2.24)\n\nFor a passive cable, in which the resting potential is assumed to be zero,\n\niion = VM (x, t)/rM\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere rM is the speciﬁc membrane resistance. Then (2.24) becomes\n\ncM\n\n∂VM ∂t\n\n=\n\na ∂2VM 2rL ∂x2\n\n−\n\nVM rM\n\n.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as\n\n(2.26)\n\nτM\n\n∂VM ∂t\n\n=\n\nλ2\n\n∂2VM ∂x2\n\n− VM\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhere\n\nλ=\n\narM 2rL\n\nand\n\nτM = cM rM\n\n(2.28)\n\nare the space or length constant and the membrane time constant, respectively. Note that the space constant depends on the geometry of the cable, that is the cable’s diameter; however, the time constant does not.\nLater, we shall give a detailed analysis of solutions to the cable equation and properties of passive dendrites. For now, it is instructive to consider steady state solutions. Suppose, for example, we consider a semi-inﬁnite cable (deﬁned for x > 0) and we inject a step of current, I0, at x = 0. As t → ∞, the solution\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n2.8.

Recall from (2.21)\n\nthat\n\nIL\n\n=\n\n−\n\nπa2 rL\n\n∂VM ∂x\n\n.\n\nIt follows that Vss must satisfy the boundary condition\n\ndVss dx\n\n(0)\n\n=\n\n−\n\nrL πa2\n\nI0.\n\n(2.30)\n\nThe solution of (2.29), (2.30) is\n\nVss(x)\n\n=\n\nλrL πa2\n\nI0 e−x/λ .\n\n(2.31)\n\nNote that the membrane potential decays exponentially. The distance at which the potential has decayed to 1/e is the space constant λ. Since the space constant is proportional to the square root of the cable’s radius, we conclude that thicker axons or dendrites have longer space constants than narrower processes. That is, thicker processes transmit signals for greater distances. As we discuss later, this is important because it inﬂuences the ability of the neuron to spatially summate incoming synaptic potentials. Moreover, the electrotonic, or passive, conduction plays an important role in the propagation of the action potential. Thicker cells with a longer space constant are more easily excited and are able to generate faster action potentials.\nThe input resistance is deﬁned to be the steady-state membrane potential, evaluated at x = 0, divided by the injected current. That is,\n\nRinp\n\n=\n\nVss(0)/I0\n\n=\n\nrLλ\n\n=\n\n1 πa3/2\n\nrM rL/2.\n\n(2.32)\n\nNote that the input resistance of the cable varies with the -3/2 power of the cable radius. Therefore, the input conductance is directly proportional to the 3/2 power of the cable radius. The input resistance is important because it is something that can be measured experimentally. Since it is also possible to measure the space constant λ, one can compute rM and rL from experimental data.\n\n2.8 The squid action potential\nWe have so far viewed the membrane as a passive cable. However, linear cables cannot transmit information over long distances unless the cable has an enormous diameter. For example, the squid axon is more than 5 centimeters long, has a diameter of about a half a millimeter, a resting membrane resistance of rM =700\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n26\n\nChapter 2. The Hodgkin-Huxley equations\n\nΩ cm2 and a transmembrane resistance of rL=30 Ω cm. Thus, the space constant for the squid axon is λ = 5.4 mm. This is an order of magnitude smaller than the length. If the potential at one end of the axon is held at 120 mV above rest, then the potential at the other end is about 10 µV above rest, a 10000-fold decrement. In order for neural signals to reach any distance, there must be another way to carry them so that they do not degrade.\nNature has solved this problem by inserting voltage-gated channels into the membranes of many cell types. These channels are proteins which selectively let diﬀerent ion species into the cell. Furthermore, the permeability of the channels depends on the local environment near the channel. In particular, for voltage gated channels, whether the channel is open or closed depends on the local potential near the channel. It is the opening and closing of voltage-gated channels that is responsible for the generation of the action potential that propagates along the axon.\nHodgkin and Huxley (1952) were the ﬁrst to provide a comprehensive, quantitative description of the regenerative currents generating the action potential. The choice of the squid axon was fortuitous since the electrical properties rely primarily on sodium and potassium ions. Consider the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 2.6 and assume that the cell is isopotential. Then the membrane potential satisﬁes\n\ncM\n\ndV dt\n\n= −gNa(V\n\n− ENa) − gK (V − EK ) − gL(V\n\n− EL).\n\nHere, we write V instead of VM . IL ≡ gL(V − EL) is called the leak current. It corresponds to passive ﬂow of ions through nongated channels. The leak conductance, gL, is constant. Since most nongated channels are permeable to K+ ions, EL is close to EK . The conductances gNa and gK may change with time since these correspond to the opening and closing of Na+ and K+ channels, respectively. At rest, gK is about 30-fold bigger than gNa so that the resting state is near EK at about -65 mV. Suppose that we could increase the conductance of gNa 100-fold. Then the resting potential would be much closer to the Nernst potential of sodium, which is about +55 mV. Thus the ampliﬁcation of the potential, such as during an action potential, involves changes in the relative conductances of the dominant ionic species. Hodgkin and Huxley’s insight was that voltage-gated channels provide the substrate for this dynamic regulation of the conductances.\nThe basic mechanisms underlying action potentials are the following. At rest, most of the sodium channels are closed so the membrane potential is determined primarily by the K+ Nernst potential. If the cell is depolarized above some threshold, then sodium channels open and this further depolarizes the cell. This allows even more sodium channels to open, allowing for more sodium ions to enter the cell and forcing the cell towards the sodium Nernst potential. This is the up-stroke of the action potential. The sodium channel is transient so that even when depolarized, the Na+ channels eventually shut down. In the meantime, the depolarization opens potassium channels and potassium ions exit the cell. This hyperpolarizes the cell as the membrane potential moves toward the potassium equilibrium potential. Until the voltage-gated potassium channels close up again, the membrane is refractory. During this time, pumps exchange excess sodium ions inside the cell with excess\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n2.8. The squid action potential\n\n27\n\nI(t)\n\nCM\n\ngL\n\ngK gNa\n\nEL\n\nEK ENa\n\nFigure 2.6.

Only a very small change in the percentage of the concentration of Na+ ions\nis needed to generate an action potential. From the exercises, we ﬁnd that approximately 53 million Na+ ions must diﬀuse across the membrane to depolarize it from -60 to +50 mV. This inﬂux in Na+ ions represents only a .012% change in the internal Na+ concentration which is typically around 12 mM. Hence, changes in\nlocal charge separation, not in concentration, are required for an action potential.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n28\n\nChapter 2. The Hodgkin-Huxley equations\n\n2.9 Voltage-gated channels\n\nIn the Hodgkin-Huxley model, each channel is viewed as a transmembrane protein\n\nthat forms a pore through which ions can diﬀuse down their concentration gradients.\n\nThe pores have gates that can be either open or closed; the probability that a gate\n\nis open or closed depends on the membrane potential. The gate model can be\n\nsummarized by the diagram:\n\nC\n\n⇀ ↽βα((VV\n\n) )\n\nO\n\n(2.33)\n\nwhere C and O correspond to the closed and open states, respectively, and α(V )\n\nand β(V ) are the voltage-dependent rate constants at which a gate goes from the\n\nopen to closed and closed to open states, respectively. If we let m be the fraction\n\nof open gates, then 1 − m is the fraction of closed gates, and, from the law of mass\n\naction,\n\ndm dt\n\n=\n\nα(V\n\n)(1 − m)\n\n− β(V )m\n\n=\n\n(m∞(V\n\n) − m)/τ (V )\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhere\n\nm∞(V )\n\n=\n\nα(V ) α(V ) + β(V\n\n)\n\nand\n\nτ (V\n\n)\n\n=\n\nα(V\n\n)\n\n1 +\n\nβ(V\n\n).\n\n(2.35)\n\nIt is easy to solve this equation if V is constant. The solution starting at m(0) is\n\nm(t) = m∞(V ) + (m(0) − m∞(V ))e−t/τ(V ).\n\nNote that the solution approaches the steady-state m∞(V ) at a rate determined by the time-constant τ (V ).\nOne must obtain expressions for the voltage-dependent rate constants α and β. In the Hodgkin-Huxley model, these functions were derived by ﬁtting the data. Borg-Graham and others have suggested a simple formulation based on thermodynamics. The idea is that the probability of opening or closing a channel depends exponentially on the potential. Thus,\n\nα(V ) = Aα exp(−BαV ) and β(V ) = Aβ exp(−BβV ).\n\n(2.36)\n\nFrom this, we ﬁnd that\n\nm∞(V )\n\n=\n\n1 1 + exp(−(V\n\n−\n\nVh)/Vs)\n\nwhere Vh, Vs are constants. We leave as an exercise the calculation of these constants in terms of the constants A and B. The time constant, τ (V ) will generally be a skewed bell-shaped function of V. If Bβ = −Bα, then τ (V ) is a hyperbolic secant.\n\n2.10 Hodgkin-Huxley model\nWe are now ready to derive the Hodgkin-Huxley model for the propagation of an action potential along the squid’s giant axon. As in Section 2.7, we view the axon as a cylinder of ﬁxed radius, a, so the membrane potential depends on the spatial\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n2.10. Hodgkin-Huxley model\n\n29\n\nvariable x and time t. Here we assume that there are voltage-gated K+ and Na+ channels and a leak current. Then balancing currents, as in (2.23), we have\n\nIL = Icap + Iion\n\n(2.37)\n\nor, using (2.6) and (2.24),\n\na ∂2VM 2rL ∂x2\n\n=\n\ncM\n\n∂VM ∂t\n\n+ IK\n\n+ INa + IL.\n\n(2.38)\n\nIf each ionic current is Ohmic, then this can be written as\n\ncM\n\n∂VM ∂t\n\n=\n\na ∂2VM 2rL ∂x2\n\n− gK (VM\n\n− EK ) − gNa(VM\n\n− ENa) − gL(VM\n\n− EL).\n\n(2.39)\n\nTo complete the model, we need to describe how one computes the membrane\n\nconductances gK , gNa and gL. Note that the voltage-gated conductances gK and gNa change with time during an action potential.\n\nHodgkin and Huxley used two experimental methods in order to separate\n\nthe ionic currents and compute how the K+ and Na+ conductances depend on\n\nvoltage. The ﬁrst was a simple feedback circuit called the voltage-clamp that allows\n\nthe experimenter to hold the membrane potential at a constant or holding level\n\nVC . The voltage clamp does so by injecting a current into the axon that is equal\n\nand opposite to the current ﬂowing through the voltage-gated channels. Electrical\n\ndetails can be found in Johnston and Wu. Note that the voltage-clamp separates the\n\ntotal membrane current into its ionic and capacitive components. Recall that the\n\ncapacitive current satisﬁes Icap = CM dVM /dt. If the membrane potential is ﬁxed at some constant, then the capacitive current must be zero. Moreover, the total\n\ncurrent can be made spatially uniform by inserting a highly conductive axial wire\n\ninside\n\nthe\n\nﬁber;\n\nthe\n\naxon\n\nis\n\nthen\n\nsaid\n\nto\n\nbe\n\nspace-clamped.\n\nIn\n\nthis\n\ncase,\n\n∂ 2 VM ∂x2\n\n= 0.\n\nIt then follows that any changes in current must be due either to the leak or to the\n\nopening and closing of voltage-gated membrane channels.\n\nWe ﬁrst consider how the voltage-clamp can be used to determine the leak-\n\nconductance, gL. Note that most of the voltage-gated channels are closed at rest. Moreover, if we hyperpolarize the cell, then we may assume that all of the voltage-\n\ngated channels are closed. It follows that if the membrane potential is clamped at\n\nsome suﬃciently strong hyperpolarized level, then the total current is given by the\n\nleak; that is,\n\nIM ≈ gL(VC − EL).\n\nFrom this equation, we can easily solve for gL. Figure 2.8 shows the results of a voltage-clamp experiment when the mem-\nbrane potential is clamped at 0 mV. Note that there is an inward current followed\nby an outward current. This result suggests that the depolarizing voltage step turns on two voltage-gated channels. The inward current is due to the inﬂux of Na+ ions, while the outward current is due to the outward ﬂow of K+ ions. It is not clear,\nhowever, how these two separate ions contribute to the total membrane current.\nFor this it is necessary to isolate the two voltage-gated currents.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n30\n\nChapter 2.

The membrane potential is stepped from rest to 0 mV. This results in an inward current followed by an outward current. The separate potassium and sodium currents are also shown.\n\nHodgkin and Huxley were able to isolate the K+ current by replacing Na+ ions\nin the external bathing solution with a larger, impermeant cation. This eliminated the inward Na+ current. Now there are dozens of compounds that selectively block\ndiﬀerent currents, many derived from natural toxins. (For example, the compound\ntetrodotoxin, which blocks sodium channels, comes from the Paciﬁc puﬀerﬁsh, a tasty, if slightly dangerous, Japanese delicacy called fugu.) Once Na+ is removed,\nthe voltage-clamp can be used to determine how IK depends on the membrane potential. That is, one holds the membrane potential at various levels and determines the time-course of the total membrane current IM . If Na+ is removed, then the potassium current is computed by subtracting the leak current from IM .\nIt is also now possible to block K+ channels using the drug tetraethylammo-\nnium. However, this was not available to Hodgkin and Huxley. However, if IK and IL are known, then one computes INa simply by subtracting IK and IL from IM . Once these currents are determined, we can calculate the IK and INa conductances using Ohm’s law. That is,\n\ngK (t)\n\n=\n\nIK (t) (VM − EK )\n\nand\n\ngN a(t)\n\n=\n\nIN a (t) (VM − EN\n\na\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(2.40)\n\nFigure 2.9 shows the IK and INa conductances for diﬀerent levels of the holding potential. Note than gNa turns on more rapidly that gK . Moreover, the Na+ channels begin to close before the depolarization is turned oﬀ, while the K+ channels remain open as long as the membrane is depolarized. This suggests that the Na+\nchannel can exist in three states: resting, activated and inactivated. When the cell is depolarized, the Na+ channels switch from the resting (closed) to the activated\n(open) state. If the depolarization is maintained, then the channel switches to the\ninactivated (closed) state.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n2.10.

Numerically computed voltage-clamp experiment. The membrane potential is stepped to diﬀerent values and the resulting potassium and sodium conductances are computed.\n\nA physical interpretation of the Na+ channel is shown in Figure 2.10. There are two gates in the sodium channel: a fast one (the activation gate) represented by the line and a slow one (the inactivation gate) represented by the ball. Both gates must be open for the channel to conduct Na+ ions. At rest, the activation gate is closed and the inactivation gate is open. When the membrane is depolarized, the activation gate opens which allows sodium into the cell. The inactivation gate (ball) closes at the higher potential so that the ﬂow of sodium is transient. Hodgkin and Huxley used a more complicated voltage clamp protocol, ﬁrst stepping to a ﬁxed voltage and then apply brief voltage steps to probe the fast activation and slow inactivation gates. Details can be found in Kandel/Schwartz/Jessell.\nUsing the voltage-clamp data, Hodgkin and Huxley derived expressions for the K+ and Na+ conductances. They proposed that\n\ngK = g¯K n4 and gNa = g¯Nam3h\n\n(2.41)\n\nwhere g¯K and g¯Na are maximum conductances and n, m and h are gating variables that take values between 0 and 1. Hence, n4 represents the probability that a potassium channel is open: the potassium channel has 4 independent components each of which are identical. The probability that the sodium activation gate is open is m3 and the probability that the sodium inactivation gate is open is 1 − h. Each of the gating variables satisﬁes a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation of the form (2.34). That is, they satisfy equations of the form:\n\ndn dt\n\n=\n\nαn(V\n\n)(1\n\n−\n\nn)\n\n−\n\nβn(V\n\n)n\n\n=\n\n(n∞(V ) − n)/τn(V )\n\ndm dt\n\n=\n\nαm(V\n\n)(1\n\n−\n\nm)\n\n−\n\nβm(V\n\n)m\n\n=\n\n(m∞(V ) − m)/τm(V )\n\ndh dt\n\n=\n\nαh(V\n\n)(1\n\n−\n\nh)\n\n−\n\nβh(V\n\n)h\n\n=\n\n(h∞(V ) − h)/τh(V ).\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n32\nV(t) I Na\nV rest\n\nChapter 2.

In the case of a spaced-clamped squid axon, we write these\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n34\n\nChapter 2.

It is important to realize that the temperature at which an experiment is done can be very important. Since channels are stochastic in nature, they are sensitive to the temperature so that the rates of switching states depend exponentially on the temperature. Higher temperatures cause faster switching. Thus, there is a factor:\n\nφ = Q(1T0 −Tbase)/10.\n\n(2.44)\n\nQ10 is the ratio of the rates for an increase in temperature by 10◦ C. For the squid, Tbase = 6.3◦ C and Q10 = 3.\nFigure 2.13 shows solutions of these equations in response to diﬀerent levels of steps in currents. Note that there is “all-or-none” behavior: When the applied current is below some threshold, the membrane potential returns quickly to rest; when the current is above some threshold, there is an action potential. If the applied current is suﬃciently large and held for a suﬃciently long time, then the model generates a periodic response.\n\n40\nV (mV)\n20\n0\n−20\n−40\n−60\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\ntime (msec)\n\n40\nV (mV)\n20\n0\n−20\n−40\n−60\n−80 0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\ntime (msec)\n\nFigure 2.13.

Also shown are the sodium and potassium conductances.\n\nthe inward and outward ﬂow of sodium and potassium ions. Here we give a more\n“mathematical” explanation in terms of the behavior of the dependent variables in\nthe diﬀerential equations.\nWhen we depolarize the cell, we change the values of the activation curves:\nn∞(V ) and m∞(V ) increase, while h∞(V ) decreases. Since n, m and h tend towards their activation curves, it follows that n and m initially increase, while h\ndecreases. That is, potassium channels open, while sodium channels both activate\nand inactivate. However, τm is much smaller than both τh and τn. It follows that the Na+ channels activate much faster than they inactivate or K+ channels open. Therefore, the Na+ conductance, gNa = g¯Nam3h, increases faster than gK = g¯n4.\nThe increase in the Na+ conductance leads to a large increase in the Na+\ncurrent, INa = gNa(V − ENa). As long as the cell is near rest, the driving force V − ENa is large (recall that ENa ≈ +55mV ). Hence, the sodium current will dominate the equation for the membrane potential and V will increase towards the Na+ Nernst potential. As V increases, m∞(V ) increases further, leading to further increase in Na+ activation.\nAs V increases towards ENa, sodium channels inactivate. This is because h → h∞(V ) ≈ 0. Moreover, the sodium driving force V − ENa decreases. For both reasons, the Na+ current turns oﬀ. Meanwhile, the potassium channel activates because n → n∞(V ) ≈ 1. Moreover, the K+ driving force V − EK becomes very large. It follows that eventually, the potassium current dominates and the membrane potential must fall back towards the K+ Nernst potential. This corresponds\nto the down-stroke of the action potential.\nAfter the action potential, the cell is hyperpolarized with m∞ ≈ 0, n∞ ≈ 0 and h∞ ≈ 1. After some time, m, n and h approach their steady state values and\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n36\n\nChapter 2.

These textbooks include Kandel, Schwartz and Jessell [28], Hille [22] and Martin [36]. The reader is also highly recommended to look at Hodgkin and Huxley’s original papers [1]. A review of these papers, along with a short history leading up to them, is given in Rinzel [42]. Excellent textbooks, which emphasize modeling and quantitative approaches, are Johnston and Wu [?], Koch [30], Jack et. al.[25], Izhikevich izhikevichbook, and Dayan and Abbott [10]. Keener and Sneyd [29] and Fall et. al. [14] give detailed introductions to mathematical aspects of cellular biophysics.\n2.13 Exercises\n1.

Dendrites are very important for many reasons. Indeed, the majority of the total membrane area of many neurons is occupied by the dendritic tree. Dendrites enable neurons to connect to thousands of other cells, far more than would be possible with just a soma, as there is a huge membrane area to make connections. Dendrites may direct many subthreshold postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) towards the soma, which summates these inputs and determines if the neuron will ﬁre an action potential. In addition to the tree-like structure of dendrites, many dendrites have additional ﬁne structures at the ends of the branches called spines. During development, animals that are raised in rich sensory environments have more extensive dendritic tress and more spines.\n3.1 Multiple compartments\nA very useful way to treat complicated dendritic structures is the compartimental approach. Here one divides the dendritic tree into small segments or compartments that are all linked together. Examples are shown in Figure ??. Each compartment is assumed to be isopotential and spatially uniform in its properties. Diﬀerences in voltage and nonuniformity in membrane properties, including diameter, occur between compartments rather than within them.\nAs a simple example, consider the two-compartment model shown in Figure ??. An equivalent circuit for this model is shown in Figure ??. Each compartment is viewed as an isopotential cylinder with radius ai and length Li. Let Vi be the membrane potential of the ith compartment and let ci and rMi be the corresponding speciﬁc membrane capacitance and speciﬁc membrane resistivity, respectively. We assume that each compartment has an electrode current and the total electrode current is given by Ieilectrode. Finally, we assume that the intracellular, or longitudinal, resistivity is given by rL.\nNow the capacitive and ionic currents for each compartment must be balanced\n39\n\ni i\n\n40\n\nChapter 3. Dendrites\n\nby the longitudinal and electrode currents. That is,\n\niicap + iiion = iilong + iielectrode\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere iicap and iiion are the capacitve and ionic currents per unit area of membrane for compartment i. As before,\n\niicap\n\n=\n\nci\n\ndVi dt\n\nand\n\niiion\n\n=\n\nVi rM i\n\n(3.2)\n\nif we assume that the resting potential is 0. In order to compute iilong, we need to determine total axial resistance. Note that the total resistance between the centers\n\nof the two comparments is simply the sum of the two resistances of the half-cylinders\n\nthat separate the compartment centers. That is the total resistance is given by:\n\nRlong\n\n=\n\nrLL1 2πa21\n\n+\n\nrLL2 2πa22\n\n(3.3)\n\nUsing Ohm’s law, we can write the expressions for the current from comparments i\n\nto compartment j as\n\ni1long = g1,2(V2 − V1) and i2long = g2,1(V1 − V2).\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe coupling terms g1,2 and g2,1 are obtained by inverting (3.3) and dividing by the surface area of the compartment of interest. That is,\n\ng1,2\n\n=\n\na1a22 rLL1(a22L1 + a21L2\n\nand\n\ng2,1\n\n=\n\nrLL1\n\na2a21 (a22L1 +\n\na21L2\n\n.\n\nFinally, to compute iielectrode, we divide the total electrode currents by the surface areas of the compartments. That is,\n\niielectrode\n\n=\n\nIeilectrode Ai\n\nwhere Ai = 2πaiLi is the surface area of compartment i. Putting this all together, we ﬁnd that the equations for two connected cylinders\n\nare:\n\nc1\n\ndV1 dt\n\n+\n\nV1 rm1\n\n= g1,2(V2 − V1) +\n\nIe1lectrode A1\n\nc2\n\ndV2 dt\n\n+\n\nV2 rm2\n\n= g2,1(V1 − V2) +\n\nIe2lectrode A2\n\n(3.5)\n\nIf instead of using conductances, gi,j, we use r1 = 1/g1,2 and r2 = 1/g2,1 then we can express this system as:\n\nc1\n\ndV1 dt\n\n+\n\nV1 rm1\n\n=\n\nV2 − V1 r1\n\n+ i1\n\nc2\n\ndV2 dt\n\n+\n\nV2 rm2\n\n=\n\nV1 − V2 r2\n\n+ i2\n\n(3.6)\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n3.1. Multiple compartments\n\n41\n\nwhere ii = Ieilectrode/Ai. We can now explore the eﬀects of two compartments on the input resistance of\nthe “cell.” Suppose that we inject current into cell 1 only. Moreover, each cylinder is identical with the same length and radius. Then r1 = r2 ≡ r. What is the input resistance due to the coupling? To solve this, we must compute the steady state potential due to the coupling. Without loss in generality, deﬁne rM = rM1 = rM2. A simple bit of algebra shows that\n\nV1/i1\n\n=\n\nrM (r + rM ) r + 2rM\n\nand thus the ratio of the coupled to the uncoupled input resistance is:\n\nRinput,coupled Rinput,uncoupled\n\n=1−\n\nr\n\nrM + 2rm\n\n;\n\nthat is, the input resistance decreases. To get the same increment in potential the current required for the coupled system is more than the uncoupled system because some current is drained away by the second compartment.\nIn a similar way, we can derive a compartmental model for a general tree-like structure. A general algorithm for computing the correct equations is:\n\n• For each cylinder, j, with radius and length aj and Lj in microns, compute\n\nsurface\n\narea,\n\nAj\n\n=\n\n2πaj Lj\n\nand\n\nthe\n\naxial\n\nresistance\n\nfactor:\n\nQj\n\n=\n\n. Lj\nπa2j\n\n• The membrane capacitance is Cj = cjAj × 10−8 and the membrane resistance is Rj = (rmj/Aj ) × 108.\n\n•\n\nThe coupling resistance between compartment j and k is Rjk\n\n=\n\nrL 2\n\n(Qj\n\n+\n\nQk\n\n)\n\n×\n\n104.\n\n• The equations are then\n\nCj\n\ndVj dt\n\n=\n\n−\n\nVj Rj\n\n+\nk\n\nconnected j\n\nVk − Vj Rjk\n\n+ Ij .\n\nThe factors of 10±8 and 104 are the conversion from microns to centimeters. For\nexample, consider a two compartment model with (i) compartment 1 having a\nlength of 200µ and radius of 30µ and (ii) compartment 2 having a length of 20µ and radius of 20µ. Then, R1 = 2.65 × 107Ω, C1 = 3.77 × 10−10F ,R2 = 3.98 × 108Ω, C2 = 2.52 × 10−11F , and Rlong = 4.34 × 104Ω, thus\n\n10\n\ndV1 dt\n\n=\n\n−V1\n\n+ 611(V2\n\n− V1),\n\n10\n\ndV2 dt\n\n=\n\n−V2\n\n+ 9181(V2\n\n−\n\nV1)\n\nwhere the time is in milliseconds and the coupling coeﬃcients are dimensionless. Note how the ratio of the coupling strengths is the same as the reciprocal of the area ratios. The bigger compartment has a much greater eﬀect on the smaller compartment than vice versa.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n42\nA\n\nChapter 3. Dendrites\n\nB 3\n2\n1\nFigure 3.1. A. Branched dendrite converted to a series of cylinders for modeling. B. Simple 3 compartment model.\nWe also would like to remark that the standard units used in most compartmental models are µF/cm2, mS/cm2, and µA/cm2 for the capacitance, conductance, and applied current. Experimentalists don’t generally know the current density but only the total current injected. Typical currents injected into a cell are of the order of less than a nanoampere.\nTo generate arbitrary compartmental models, one needs only to compute the length, diameter, and the connectivity of the cylinders that make up the dendritic tree. The software NEURON enables an experimentalist to input a digitized picture of a neuron and the program will automatically produce a compartmental model of the neuron by linking together many cylinders.\n3.1.1 Homework\n1.

Solve this equation assuming the cell starts from rest. For what values of Vsyn does V (t) increase above rest?\n\n3.2 The cable equation.\n\nMathematically, dendrites and axons are regarded as continuous media rather than a series of compartments. Previously, we derived the cable equation for a simple cable in which the radius along the cable was assumed to be constant. Here we derive the cable equation for more general geometries. This is done by considering the limit as the number of compartments in an approximation of it tends to inﬁnity.\nSuppose the cable is deﬁned on the interval (0, ℓ) with a circular cross-section and diameter d(x). We break the cable into n pieces and deﬁne xj = jh where h = ℓ/n. Each piece has a surface area Aj = πdjh where dj = d(xj ), and crossectional area, πd2j /4. Let cM and rM denote the speciﬁc membrane capacitance and resistance, and let rL be the longitudinal resistance. Then, neglecting the end points, the voltage satisﬁes:\n\ncM\n\nAj\n\ndVj dt\n\n=\n\n−\n\nVj rM /Aj\n\n+\n\nVj+1 − Vj 4rLh/(πd2j+1)\n\n+\n\nVj−1 − Vj 4rLh/(πd2j )\n\nNote that we use the larger diameter for the transmembrane resistance; in simula-\n\ntions, the average of the two would be preferred. Dividing by πh the coupling term\n\nsimpliﬁes to:\n\n1 h\n\nd2j+1(Vj+1 − 4rLh\n\nVj )\n\n−\n\nd2j (Vj − Vj−1) 4rLh\n\n.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n3.3. Linear cables with constant diameter.\n\n45\n\nAs h → 0, this goes to the diﬀusion operator:\n\n1∂ 4rL ∂x\n\nd2\n\n(x)\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n.\n\nThus, the cable equation has the form:\n\ncm\n\n∂V ∂t\n\n=\n\n−\n\nV rM\n\n+\n\n1 4rL\n\n∂ ∂x\n\nd2(x)\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n.\n\n(3.7)\n\nWe remark that the term\n\nd2j (Vj−1 − Vj ) 4rLh\n\nhas dimensions of current and in the limit as h → 0 is called the longitudinal current:\n\nIL\n\n=\n\n−\n\nπd2(x) 4rL\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n.\n\n(3.8)\n\nIf one is interested only in the passive cable and d(x) = d is constant, then\n\nit is convenient to multiply both sides by rM and divide by d obtaining the linear\n\ncable equation:\n\nτ\n\n∂V ∂t\n\n=\n\n−V\n\n+\n\nλ2\n\n∂2V ∂x2\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere\n\nλ=\n\ndrM 4rL\n\n(3.10)\n\nis the space constant. Since λ depends on the diameter of the cable, this parameter\n\ndepends on the geometry of the cable. The quantity, τ = rM cM is the time constant and is independent of geometry. For example, if cM = 1µF/cm2, rM = 20000Ωcm2, rL = 100Ωcm and the diameter of the cable is 2 microns, then τ = 20 msec and λ = 1 mm.\n\n3.3 Linear cables with constant diameter.\n\n3.3.1 The inﬁnite cable\n\nWe ﬁrst consider the inﬁnite cable, so that −∞ < x < ∞, with some applied\n\ncurrent:\n\nτ\n\n∂V ∂t\n\n+\n\nV\n\n(x,\n\nt)\n\n−\n\nλ2\n\n∂2V ∂x2\n\n= rM I(x, t).\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe current, I(x, t) has units of µA/cm2. Additionally, we also must provide an\n\ninitial voltage distribution, V (x, 0) = V0(x).

However, for the ﬁnite and semi-inﬁnite cables there are several interesting boundary conditions that are often used:\n\n• sealed end where no current can pass and so the longitudinal current IL = 0.\n\nIt\n\nthen\n\nfollows\n\nfrom\n\n(3.8)\n\nthat\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n(0)\n\n=\n\n0.\n\n• current injected at one end where a current of magnitude I(t) is injected at,\n\nsay,\n\nthe\n\nend\n\nx=\n\n0.\n\nIn\n\nthis\n\ncase,\n\n∂V ∂x\n\n(0)\n\n=\n\n4rL πd2\n\nI\n\n(t).\n\n• voltage clamp in which the voltage is clamped to some ﬁxed level, so that V (0) = Vc, a constant.\n\n• short circuit or open end where the voltage is clamped to 0.\n\n• lumped soma where we regard the soma as a single compartment attached to the nerve cable. Suppose that the soma has total resistance Rs and capacitance Cs. Then the boundary condition at x = 0 is\n\nV\n\n(0, Rs\n\nt)\n\n+\n\nCsVt(0,\n\nt)\n\n−\n\nπd2 4rL\n\nVx(0,\n\nt)\n\n=\n\n0\n\nNote that the general steady-state equation, 0 = −V + λ2Vxx has solutions of the equivalent forms:\nV (x) = A1e−x/λ + A2ex/λ V (x) = B1 cosh((l − x)/λ) + B2 sinh((l − x)/λ) V (x) = C1 cosh(x/λ) + C2 sinh(x/λ)\nThe constants are determined from the boundary conditions. First consider the semi-inﬁnite cable. This has a solution of the form V (x) = A exp(−x/λ). Suppose\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n48\n\nChapter 3. Dendrites\n\nthat we inject current, I0 into the end of the cable. Recall that the longitudinal current is I0 = −(πd2/4rL)dV /dx. Thus, we ﬁnd that\n\nA\n\n=\n\n4λI0rL πd2\n\n.\n\nRecall that the input resistance, Rinp of a cable as the ratio of the steady state potential divided by the current injected. Thus, for the semi-inﬁnite cable,\n\nRinp\n\n=\n\nV (0)/I(0)\n\n=\n\n4λrL πd2\n\n=\n\n2√rM rL πd3/2\n\nand the input conductance is given by\n\nGinp\n\n=\n\n1/Rinp\n\n=\n\nπd3/2 2√rM rL\n\n.\n\nFor ﬁnite cables, it is convenient to use dimensionless space, X = x/λ and the electrotonic length, L = ℓ/λ. Assume that the voltage at X = 0 is V0. Then the general solution to the steady-state equation is:\n\nV\n\n(X )\n\n=\n\nV0\n\ncosh(L − X) cosh L\n\n+ +\n\nBL BL\n\nsinh(L sinh L\n\n−\n\nX)\n\nwhere BL is an arbitrary constant. This general solution is equivalent to asserting that the boundary condition at X = 0 is V0 and that at X = L\n\nBLV\n\n(L)\n\n+\n\ndV dX\n\n(L)\n\n=\n\n0.\n\nThe free parameter, BL, is the ratio of the terminal conductance for the cable, GL,\n\nto that of the semi-inﬁnite cable, Ginp. That is, BL = GL/Ginp.\n\nFor example, if we want the sealed end condition at X = L we take BL = 0\n\nso that\n\nV\n\n(X\n\n)\n\n=\n\nV0\n\ncosh(L − cosh L\n\nX\n\n)\n\n.\n\nIf we want the open end conditions, we take BL = ∞ so that\n\nV\n\n(X\n\n)\n\n=\n\nV0\n\nsinh(L − X sinh L\n\n)\n\n.\n\nIf we choose BL = 1 then\n\nV (X) = V0e−X\n\nwhich is precisely the solution to the semi-inﬁnite cable. From these equations for the membrane potential, we can compute the input\nresistance and input conductance of a ﬁnite-length cable. For example, consider the sealed end condition at X = L. Suppose that a current, I0, is injected into the other end at X = 0. Then the input resistance is given by\n\nRinp = V (0)/I0 = V0/I0.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n3.5.

Here, we brieﬂy look at branch points and describe the Rall model for dendrites. Figure 3.2 hows a simple branched dendritic structure. Consider the cable with diameter d0, length ℓ0 and space constant λ0 which branches at x = x1 into two semi-inﬁnite cables with diameters d1 and d2 and space constants λ1 and λ2. The cable equation for such a structure can be solved on the individual segments coupled with continuity of the voltages and the conservation of current. Under certain constraints on the geometry, we can attain a stronger result than continuity of the voltage and its derivative that is important physically and allows us to signiﬁcantly simplify the problem. With these constraints on the geometry, we will show that having the branch point at x1 is exactly equivalent to extending branch d0 to inﬁnity.\nConservation of current implies that the current leaving the branch d0 equals the sum of the currents entering branches d1 and d2. That is,\n\nπd20 4rL\n\nV0′(x1)\n\n=\n\nπd21 4rL\n\nV1′(x1\n\n)\n\n+\n\nπd22 4rL\n\nV2′(x1\n\n).\n\n(3.15)\n\nHere we assume that the material properties of the cables are the same; only their geometry diﬀers. Now, if we let V0 ≡ V0(x1) = V1(x1) = V2(x1), then\n\nV1(x) = V0eλ1x and V2(x) = V0e−λ2x\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n50\n\nChapter 3. Dendrites\n\nfor x > x1. Moreover, if Veq(x) is the membrane potential of the cable obtained by extending branch d0 to inﬁnity, then\nVeq (x) = V0eλ0x.\n\nPlugging these into (3.15), and recalling that λj ∝ dj, we ﬁnd that we can collapse the three cables 0, 1, and 2 into a single semi-inﬁnite cable with diameter d0 if\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\nd02 = d12 + d22\n\n(3.16)\n\nWill Rall was the ﬁrst to recognize that if (3.16) is satisﬁed and the material properties of the cables are the same, then the three cables 0, 1 and 2 can be collapsed into an equivalent cylinder. For a complex structure, starting at the ends, we can recursively simplify the model to a single semi-inﬁnite cylinder. In the previous example, we considered only two branches at the branch point; however, we could have had any number of branches at each branch point as long as\n\n3\n\n3\n\ndP2 =\n\ndD2\n\nwhere dP is the parent dendrite and dD are the daughter dendrites. If this condition holds at every branch point and the material properties of the cables are the same, then the entire dendritic tree can be reduced to an equivalent semi-inﬁnite cable.\nWe have so far assumed that the branches attached to the ﬁnal branch point extend to inﬁnity; that is, they correspond to semi-inﬁnite cables. A similar analysis holds if we assume that all of the branches have ﬁnite lengths. Here we must assume that all dendrites end at the same electrotonic length. Recall that the electronic length of a cable of length ℓ and space constant λ is ℓ/λ. Suppose, for example, that the cables 1 and 2 shown in Figure ?? have lengths ℓ1 and ℓ2. If we assume that ℓ1/λ1 = ℓ2/λ2, then we can collapse the three cables 0, 1 and 2 into a single cable of diameter d0 and electrotonic length equal to ℓ0/λ0 + ℓ1/λ1 = ℓ0/λ0 + ℓ2/λ2.\n\nExample\n\nIn the ﬁgure 3.3, we depict a dendritic tree consisting of several branches with their lengths and diameters in microns. (a) Can they be reduced to an equivalent cylinder (b) What is the electrotonic length (c) What is the input conductance. Assume sealed ends for all terminal dendrites and assume that rM = 2000Ωcm2 and that rL = 60Ωcm.\nAnswer.\nd3a/2 + d3b/2 + d3c/2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 = 2.083/2 = d3d/2\nd3d/2 + d3e/2 = 3 + 3 = 6 = 3.33/2 = d3f/2\nso the 3/2 rule is obeyed. Clearly a,b,c are all the same electrotonic length. The space constants are:\n\nλa = λb = λc = darM /4rL = 289µ\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n3.5.

However, there are limitations. For example,\n\none must assume that the so-called 3/2 law (see (3.16)) is satisﬁed. Another dif-\n\nﬁculty is related to the problem of determining the response of the dendritic tree\n\nto an injected current. Consider, for example, the simple dendritic tree shown in\n\nFigure 3.2. If the injection site is along the principle initial cylinder, then the equiv-\n\nalent cylinder will determine how the membrane potential responses at this and the\n\ndaughter dendrites. However, if the injection site is along the daughter dendrites,\n\nthen, in order to use the equivalent circuit, one must assume that the current is\n\nspread out evenly along all of the daughter dendrites that emerge from the same\n\njunction point. One cannot use the equivalent circuit if only one of the daughter\n\ndendrites receives input and the others receive none.\n\nIn this section, we consider a single isolated junction of three semi-inﬁnite\n\ncables with a point source of current injection. We do not assume that the 3/2 law\n\nholds. We note that a considerably more general analysis for dendritic trees with\n\ncomplex geometries is given in [Rinzel/Rall].\n\nWe consider the branched cable shown in Figure ??. The three cables are\n\ndenoted as C0, C1 and C2. Assume that the diameters and speciﬁc membrane\n\nresistance of the cables are di and rMi, i = 0, 1, 2, respectively. Let rL be the\n\nlongitudinal resistivity. We assume that the junction point is at x = 0. Moreover, x\n\nwill denote the distance along each cable to the junction point. Finally, we assume\n\nthat there is an electrode current at an isolated point along C0; the distance from\n\nthis point to the junction point is denoted as y. Note that C0 may be either the\n\nparent dendrite or one of the daughter dendrites.\n\nWe derive the steady-state solution to this problem. Except at the junction\n\nand the injection points, each membrane potential Vi(x) satisﬁes the steady-state\n\ncable equation:\n\nλi\n\n∂2Vi ∂x2\n\n−\n\nVi\n\n=\n\n0\n\nwhere\n\nλi =\n\ndi rM i 4rL\n\nis the space constant of corresponding cable. We now need to determine the boundary conditions that must be satisﬁed. At the junction point, the three membrane\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n3.7. Exercises\n\n53\n\npotentials must be equal; moreover, the ﬂow of current must be conserved. Hence,\n\nV0(0) = V1(0) = V2(0) and\n\nd2i\n\ndVi dx\n\n(0)\n\n=\n\n0.\n\nAt the electrode site, the injection current is conserved and spreads towards (de-\n\ncreasing x) or away from (increasing x) the junction point. Recall that the lon-\n\ngitudinal current is given by (3.8). It follows that the boundary condition at the\n\njunction point is:\n\ndV0 dx\n\n(y−)\n\n−\n\ndV0 dx\n\n(y+\n\n)\n\n=\n\n4rL πd20\n\nI0\n\nwhere I0 is the total electrode current and the two terms on the left hand side represent the left-handed and right-handed derivatives of V0 at y, respectively.\nWe leave it as an exercise to demonstrate that the solution of this problem is given by:\n\nV0(x)\n\n=\n\nI0 Rλ0 2\n\n[exp(−|y\n\n− x|/λ0)\n\n+\n\n(2p0\n\n−\n\n1)exp(−(y\n\n+\n\nx)/λ0)]\n\nV1(x) = p1I0Rλ1 exp(−x/λ1 − y/λ0)\n\nV2(x) = p2I0Rλ2 exp(−x/λ2 − y/λ0)\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere, for i = 0, 1, 2,\n\npi\n\n=\n\nd31/2\n\nd3i /2 + d32/2\n\n+ d33/2\n\nand\n\nRλi\n\n=\n\n4rLλi πd2i\n\n.\n\nAn example is shown in Figure ??. If the injection site is along the thicker dendrite, then this has little eﬀect on the attenuation of the potential along the thin branches. However, if the injection since is along on of the thinner dendrites, then the big dendrite has a much greater eﬀect on the attenuation between the two thinner branches.\n\n3.7 Exercises\n1.

Consider a cable with three currents, as shown in ﬁgure equivcyl. Suppose that the concentrations of the ions are those given for the squid axon in table 2.3 and that the permeabilities are PK = 1, PCl = 0.1 and PNa = .03. Suppose the temperature is 20 C. Let I(V ) denote the total current as deﬁned by (2.3). Simulate the response to the following cable:\n\nCm\n\n∂V ∂t\n\n=\n\n−I (V\n\n)\n\n+\n\nK\n\n∂2V ∂x2\n\nto a current step at x = 0. You can make Cm = 1, K = 1 without loss of generality since these just set the time and space scales. Compare this to the passive linear conductance cable model. Convince yourself that there is very little diﬀerence. In particular, you might want to solve the steady state boundary value problem for, say, V (0) = V0 and Vx(L) = 0. You cannot do this analytically, but numerical solutions should be fairly simple.\n\n3.8 Dendrites with active processes\nWe have, so far, primarily considered passive dendrites in which all of the conductances and currents are constant. However, it is now recognized that neurons may have active voltage-gated conductances along the dendritic trees and these active conductances may have a profound inﬂuence on the neuron’s ﬁring properties and how the neuron response to synaptic inputs. We note that active channels are typically unevenly distributed along the dendrites so, for example, there may be a higher\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n3.8.

Schematic of 2-compartment model showing applied currents and outward and inward currents to soma and dendrite compartments.\ndistribution of, say, sodium channels in the proximal region near the soma than in the distal region far from the soma. A useful way to model neurons with active dendrites is to use the multicompartment approach. Here we present an example of this due to Rinzel and Pinsky.\nPinsky and Rinzel developed a two-compartment model for CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in a guinea pig. This work was motivated by an earlier, considerably more complex model of Traub which consisted of 19 compartments. The reduced Pinsky-Rinzel model contained elements of the full model which were thought to be essential and was capable of reproducing many of the important stimulus-response properties of the Traub model. By considering a minimal reduced model, Pinsky and Rinzel were able to explain how interactions between the somatic and dendritic compartments generate bursting with unusual wave-forms which do not seem to arise in single-compartment models. The reduced model is also considerably easier to implement computationally.\nA schemata of the two-compartment model is shown in Figure 3.4. Motivated by Traub’s model, the fast spiking currents are restricted to the soma while most of the calcium and calcium modulated currents lie in the dendritic-like compartment. The soma-like compartment has two voltage-dependent currents, an inward sodium current and an outward delayed-rectiﬁer potassium current. The dendritic compartment has three voltage dependent currents. There is a fast calcium current and two types of potassium currents: a Ca-activated potassium current and a potassium afterhyperpolarization. Electrotonic coupling between the compartments is modeled using two parameters, gc and p, where gc represents the strength of coupling and p represents the percentage of total area in the some-like compartment. Finally, the model includes terms for applied current to the soma and dendrite.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n56\n\nChapter 3. Dendrites\n\nThe model can generate bursting activity for appropriate values of the parameters. Figure 3.5 shows the wave-form of the spiking activity during a burst. This type of activity does not typically arise in single-compartment models; it results from interactions between the two compartments. Here we step through how this burst is generated; a more complete and detailed description is given in [?].\nThe burst shown in Figure 3.5 results from electrotonic interactions between soma and dendrite with signiﬁcant coupling current that ﬂows back and forth, alternately providing depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current to each compartment. The burst sequence is initiated by a somatic sodium spike. This is because INa is activated at lower voltages that ICa. The leading sodium action potential depolarizes the dendrite through the spread of electrotonic current. The soma then repolarizes, but only partially. This causes the dendritic membrane potential to fall below the threshold for calcium spike generation, thereby delaying the full dendritic spike. During this repolarization phase, current ﬂows into the soma from the dendrite which then initiates a second somatic spike. The second somatic spike stops the drain of coupling current from the dendrite, enabling the dendrite to undergo a full ICa-mediated voltage spike with accompanying rapid increase in Ca. The dendritic spike then provides depolarization which drives soma activity. We note that the calcium dendritic spikes are considerably broader than the somatic spikes. The broad dendritic spike leads to strong stimulation of the soma which leads to damped, high frequency spiking. The dendritic calcium spike, and hence the burst, is terminated by the calcium-dependent potassium current. This builds up on a slow time-scale during the dendritic spiking activity. Hence, the burst duration is primarily determined by the amount of time required for Ca to build up. We note that the length of the silent phase is determined by slow variables q and Ca mediating the outward potassium currents. Both of these currents must decrease before a somatic action potential can be initiated.\n\n3.9 Bibliography\nMuch of the pioneering work on the modeling of dendrites was done by Wilfred Rall.

This theory allows us to interpret solutions geometrically as curves in a phase space. By studying the geometric structure of phase space, we are often able to classify the types of solutions that the model may exhibit and determine how solutions depend on the model’s parameters. For example, we can often predict if a model neuron will generate an action potential, determine for which values of the parameters the model will produce oscillations and compute how the frequency of oscillations depends on parameters.\nIn this chapter, we introduce many of the basic concepts of dynamical systems theory using a reduced 2-variable model: the Morris-Lecar equations. Although this model is considerably simpler than the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, it still exhibits many important features of neuronal activity. For example, the Morris-Lecar model generates action potentials, there is a threshold for ﬁring and the model displays sustained oscillations at elevated levels of an applied current. By considering a reduced model, we can more easily explain the geometric mechanisms underlying each of these phenomena. Moreover, we can introduce important mathematical concepts such as phase space analysis, bifurcation theory, oscillations and stability theory. Each of these concepts plays a fundamental role in the analysis of more complex systems discussed throughout the book.\n4.2 The Morris-Lecar model\nOne of the simplest models for the production of action potentials is a model proposed by Kathleen Morris and Harold Lecar. The model has three channels: a potassium channel, a leak, and a calcium channel. In the simplest version of the model, the calcium current depends instantaneously on the voltage. Thus, the\n59\n\ni i\n\n60\n\nChapter 4.

The solutions shown in Figure 4.1 demonstrate that the Morris-Lecar model\nexhibits many of the properties displayed by neurons. Here the parameters are listed in Table 4.2 under the Hopf case. Figure 4.1A demonstrates that the model is excitable if Iapp = 60. That is, there is a stable constant solution corresponding to the resting state of the model neuron. A small perturbation decays to the resting state, while a larger perturbation, above some threshold, generates an action potential. The solution (V1(t), n1(t)) ≡ (VR, nR) is constant; VR is the resting state of the model neuron. The solution (V2(t), n2(t)) corresponds to a subthreshold response. Here, V2(0) is slightly larger than VR and (V2(t), n2(t)) decays back to rest. Finally, (V3(t), n3(t)) corresponds to an action potential. Here, we start with V3(0) above some threshold. There is then a large increase of V3(t) followed by V3(t) falling below VR and then a return to rest.\nFigure 4.1B shows a periodic solution of (ML). The parameter values are exactly the same as before; however, we have increased the parameter Iapp, corresponding to the applied current. If we increase Iapp further, then the frequency of oscillations increase; if Iapp is too large, then the solution approaches a constant value.\nIn the following, we will show how dynamical systems methods can be used to mathematically analyze these solutions. The analysis is extremely useful in understanding when this type of model, for a given set of parameters, displays a particular type of behavior. The behavior may change as parameters are varied; an important goal of bifurcation theory, which we describe below, is to determine when and what types of transitions take place.\n\n4.3 The phase plane\n\nIt will be convenient to write (4.1) as\n\ndV dt\n\n= f (V, n)\n\ndn dt\n\n=\n\ng(V, n).\n\n(4.2)\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n4.3.

If (V (t), n(t)) is a solution of (4.1), then at each time t0, (V (t0), n(t0)) deﬁnes a point in the phase plane. The point changes with time, so the entire solution (V (t), n(t)) traces out a curve (or trajectory or orbit), in the\nphase plane. Of course, not every arbitrarily drawn curve in the phase plane corresponds\nto a solution of the diﬀerential equations. What is special about solution curves is\nthat the velocity vector at each point along the curve is given by the right hand side of (4.1). That is, the velocity vector of the solution curve (V (t), n(t)) at a point (V0, n0) is given by (V ′(t), n′(t)) = (f (V0, n0), g(V0, n)). This geometric property – that the vector (f (V, n), g(V, n)) always points in the direction that the solution is\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n62\n\nChapter 4. Dynamics\n\nﬂowing – completely characterizes the solution curves. Two important types of trajectories are ﬁxed points (sometimes called equilib-\nria or rest points) and closed orbits. At a ﬁxed point, f (VR, nR) = g(VR, nR) = 0; this corresponds to a constant solution. Closed orbits correspond to periodic solutions. That is, if (v(t), n(t)) represents a closed orbit, then there exists T > 0 such that (V (t), n(t)) = (V (t + T ), n(t + T )) for all t.\nA useful way to understand how trajectories behave in the phase plane is to consider the nullclines. The V-nullcline is the curve deﬁned by V ′ = f (V, n) = 0 and the n-nullcline is where n′ = g(V, n) = 0. Note that along the V-nullcline, the vector ﬁeld (f (V, n), g(V, n)) points either up or down and along the n-nullcline, vectors point either to the left or to the right. Fixed points are where the two nullclines intersect. The nullclines divide the phase plane into separate regions; in each of these regions, the vector ﬁeld points in the direction of one of the four quadrants: (I) f > 0, g > 0; (II) f < 0, g > 0; (III) f < 0, g < 0; or (IV) f > 0, g < 0.\n\nStability of ﬁxed points\n\nOne can determine the stability of a ﬁxed point by considering the linearization of the vector ﬁeld at the ﬁxed point. The linearization of (4.2) at a ﬁxed point (VR, nR) is the matrix\n\nM=\n\n∂f ∂∂Vg ∂V\n\n(VR , (VR ,\n\nnR) nR)\n\n∂f ∂∂ng ∂n\n\n(VR (VR\n\n, ,\n\nnR) nR)\n\n.\n\nThe ﬁxed point is stable if both of the eigenvalues of this matrix have negative real part; the ﬁxed point is unstable if at least one of the eigenvalues has positive real part. For (ML), the linearization is given by\n\nM=\n\n−\n\n∂\n\nIion (VR ∂V\n\n,nR\n\n)\n\n/Cm\n\n−gK(VR − EK )/Cm\n\nφn′∞(VR)/τn(VR)\n\n−φ/τn(VR)\n\n≡\n\na c\n\nb d\n\n.\n\nMoreover,\n\na\n\n≡\n\n−\n\n∂Iion(VR, ∂V\n\nnR)\n\n/Cm\n\n= (−gL − gK nR − gCam∞(VR) + (ECa − VR)gCam′∞(VR))/Cm.\n\nWe now ﬁnd conditions on the nonlinear functions in (4.1) for when the ﬁxed point is stable.\nSuppose that the equilibrium voltage lies between EK and ECa, a reasonable assumption. Then b < 0, c > 0, and d < 0 in the linearization. Only a can be either negative or positive and the only term contributing to the positivity of a is the slope of the calcium activation function, m∞(V ). If a < 0, then the ﬁxed point is asymptotically stable since the trace of M is negative and the determinant is positive. (Recall that the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues and the determinant is the product of eigenvalues.) Note that the slope of the V-nullcline near the ﬁxed point is given by −a/b. Since b < 0, it follows that if this slope is negative then\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n4.3. The phase plane\n\n63\n\nthe ﬁxed point is stable; that is, if the ﬁxed point lies along the left branch of the V-nullcline, then it is stable.\nNow suppose that the ﬁxed point lies along the middle branch of the Vnullcline, so that a > 0. Note that the slope of the n-nullcline, −c/d, is always positive. If the slope of the V-nullcline is greater than the slope of the n-nullcline, (i.e., −a/b > −c/d) then ad − bc < 0. In this case, the determinant is negative and the ﬁxed point is an unstable saddle point. In contrast, if the slope of the n-nullcline is greater than that of the V-nullcline, then the ﬁxed point is a node or a spiral. We leave it as an exercise to show that the ﬁxed point is a spiral if the parameter φ is suﬃciently small. In this case, the stability of the ﬁxed point is determined by the trace of M : the ﬁxed point is stable if a + d < 0 and it is unstable if a + d > 0. In summary, if the ﬁxed point lies along the middle branch of the V-nullcline, then it is unstable if either the slope of the V-nullcline at the ﬁxed point is suﬃciently large, or φ is suﬃciently small. Note that φ governs the speed of the potassium dynamics.\n\nExcitable systems\nRecall that for the parameters given in Table 4.2, the Hopf case, the system is excitable. As Figure 4.1A demonstrates, a small perturbation in voltage from the resting state decays back to rest, while a suﬃciently large perturbation in voltage continues to increase and generates an action potential.\nPhase plane analysis is very useful in understanding what separates the ﬁring of an action potential from the subthreshold return to rest in this model. The projection of the solutions shown in Figure 4.1A onto the phase plane are shown in Figure 4.2A. This ﬁgure also shows the V - and the n-nullclines. Note that the V -nullcline separates points along trajectories in which V ′ < 0 and V ′ > 0. In particular, V increases below the V -nullcline and V decreases above the V nullcline. We further note that the V -nullcline is ’cubic-shaped’. This suggests that a perturbation from rest that lies to the ’left’ of the middle-branch of the V nullcline will return quickly to rest, while a perturbation that lies to the ’right’ of the V -nullcline will initially display an increase in membrane potential, corresponding to an action potential, before returning to rest. Therefore, the middle-branch of the V -nullcline in some sense separates the ﬁring of an action potential from the subthreshold return to rest.\nThis analysis can be made more precise if we assume that the parameter φ is small. Looking at Table 4.2, it can be seen that φ is relatively smaller in the Hopf case than in the other two cases. For small φ, n will not change much so let’s hold it at rest. Figure 4.3 shows the phase plane with a horizontal line drawn through the ﬁxed point. If n does not change much, then the dynamics are governed by the behavior on the phase-line n = nR. Since the V -nullcline intersects this line at 3 points, there are three equilibria to the system when n is held constant. The resting state (and true equilibrium of the full system) VR is stable. There are two additional equilibria (which are not equilibria of the full model, just the model when n is held at its resting value): Vθ, which is unstable and Ve, which is stable. On this line, if the voltage is perturbed past Vθ then it will jump to the right ﬁxed\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n64\n\nChapter 4.

Otherwise, it will decay to rest, VR. This shows that for small φ, the “threshold” voltage for generating an action potential is roughly the intersection of the horizontal line through the rest state and the middle branch of the V -nullcline. Since experimentalists can only move the voltage through current injection, we can use this to estimate the magnitude of a current pulse needed to cross threshold. (See exercise 2 below.)\nWe note that the peak of the action potential occurs at some latency after the initial perturbation, but this latency can never get very large. The action potential itself is graded and takes on a continuum of peak values, as shown in Figure 4.2B. If φ is not “small” and it is increased, then the spike amplitudes are even more graded than those shown in Figure 4.2B. Recall that φ is related to the temperature of the preparation. Thus, increasing the temperature of a neuron should lead to a much less sharp threshold distinction and graded action potentials. Indeed, Cole et al demonstrated this in the squid.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n4.4.

Threshold construction for the ML model.\n\nOscillations\nWe expect the phase plane to change if a parameter in the equations changes. Figure 4.2D shows the phase plane corresponding to the periodic solution shown in Figure 4.1B. Here, Iapp = 100. Note that the periodic solution corresponds to a closed curve, or limit cycle. In general, whenever we wish to ﬁnd periodic solutions of some model, we look for closed orbits in phase space. In Figure 4.2D, there is a unique ﬁxed point; this is where the nullclines intersect. This ﬁxed point is unstable, however.\nIf we change Iapp to 90, then the model is bistable and the phase plane is shown in Figure 4.2C. Note that there exist both a stable ﬁxed point and a stable limit cycle. Small perturbations from rest will decay back to the stable ﬁxed point, while large perturbations will approach the stable periodic solution. Note that there also exists an unstable periodic solution. This orbit separates those initial conditions that approach the stable ﬁxed point from those that approach the stable limit cycle.\nIt is often diﬃcult to show that a given model exhibits stable oscillations, especially in higher dimensional systems such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Limit cycles are global objects, unlike ﬁxed points that are local. In order to demonstrate that a given point is on a periodic solution, one must follow the trajectory passing through that point and wait to see if the trajectory returns to where it started. This is clearly not a useful strategy for ﬁnding periodic solutions. A powerful method for locating oscillatory behavior is bifurcation theory, which we describe in the following section.\n4.4 Bifurcation analysis\nBifurcation theory is concerned with how solutions change as parameters in a model are varied. For example, in the previous section we showed that the Morris-Lecar equations may exhibit diﬀerent types of solutions for diﬀerent values of the applied current Iapp. If Iapp = 60, then there is a stable ﬁxed point and no oscillations, while if Iapp = 100, then the ﬁxed point is unstable and there does exist a stable\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n66\n\nChapter 4. Dynamics\n\nlimit cycle. Using bifurcation theory, we can classify the types of transitions that take place as we change parameters. In particular, we can predict for which value of Iapp the ﬁxed point loses its stability and oscillations emerge. There are, in fact, several diﬀerent types of bifurcations; that is, there are diﬀerent mechanisms by which stable oscillations emerge. The most important types of bifurcations can be realized by the Morris-Lecar model. These are described below.\n\nThe Hopf bifurcation\nIn Figure 4.4, we choose the parameters as in Table 1, the Hopf regime, and show the bifurcation diagram for (ML) as the current Iapp is varied. For each value of Iapp, there is a unique ﬁxed point, (VR(Iapp), nR(Iapp)). In Figure 4.4A, we plot VR vs. Iapp. The ﬁxed point is stable for Iapp < 94 ≡ I1 and Iapp > 212 ≡ I2; otherwise, it is unstable. A Hopf bifurcation takes place at Iapp = I1 and Iapp = I2. By this we mean the following: Recall that a ﬁxed point is stable if all of the eigenvalues of the linearization have negative real part; the ﬁxed point is unstable if at least one of the eigenvalues has positive real part. The ﬁxed point loses stability, as a parameter is varied, when at least one eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis. If the eigenvalues are all real numbers, then they can cross the imaginary axis only at the origin in the complex plane. However, if an eigenvalue is complex, then it (and its complex conjugate) will cross the imaginary axis at some point that is not at the origin. This latter case corresponds to the Hopf bifurcation and it is precisely what happens for the example we are considering. In this example, (I1, VR(I1), nR(I1)) and (I2, VR(I2), nR(I2)) are called bifurcation points. Sometimes, I1 and I2 are also referred to as bifurcation points. The Hopf Bifurcation Theorem states that (if certain technical assumptions are satisﬁed) there must exist values of the parameter Iapp near I1 and I2 such that there exist periodic solutions that lie near the ﬁxed points (VR(Iapp), nR(Iapp)). A more precise statement of the Hopf bifurcation theory can be found in numerous texts on dynamical systems.\nThe curves in Figure 4.4A represent ﬁxed points and periodic solutions of the Morris-Lecar model. This diagram was generated using the numerical software XPPAUT. The curve above the ﬁxed point curve represents the maximum voltages on the periodic orbits and the curve below the ﬁxed point curve represents the minimum voltages. The solid curves represent stable solutions and the dashed curves represent unstable solutions. The bifurcation diagram shows many interesting and important features. Note that the periodic solutions near the two bifurcations points are unstable. These unstable, small amplitude periodic solutions lie on the same side of the bifurcation points as the stable ﬁxed points. These are both examples of subcritical Hopf bifurcations. At a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, the small amplitude periodic solutions near the Hopf bifurcation point are stable and lie on the opposite side as the branch of stable ﬁxed points.\nIf 88.3 < Iapp < I1 and I2 < Iapp < 217, then (ML) is bistable. For these values of Iapp, there exists both a stable ﬁxed point and a stable periodic solution. The phase plane for Iapp = 95 is shown in Figure 4.2C. Note that small perturbations of initial conditions from the resting state will decay back to rest; however, large perturbation from rest will generate solutions that approach the stable limit cycles.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n4.4.

(C) Two-parameter bifurcation showing the curve of Hopf bifurcations as φ and Iapp vary.\n\nFigure 4.4B shows the frequency of the periodic solutions versus current. Note that the frequency lies in a narrow range between 7-16 Hz. In particular, the frequency does not approach zero as Iapp approaches the bifurcation points. This is a general property of periodic solutions that arise via the Hopf bifurcation. In the next section, we shall consider another mechanism for the generation of stable limit cycles. In that mechanism, the frequency does approach zero.\nFinally, we can ask what happens if we change the speed of the potassium kinetics. Figure 4.4C shows a two-parameter diagram with φ along the vertical axis and Iapp along the horizontal axis. This shows the locus of Hopf bifurcations in these two parameters. For ﬁxed values of φ below about 0.4, there are two currents at which the Hopf bifurcation occurs. Inside the curve, the rest state is stable. One can numerically show that the Hopf bifurcation is subcritical outside the interval, 124.47 < Iapp < 165.68; inside this interval, the bifurcation is supercritical. The reader can choose, for example, φ = .35 and show that both Hopf bifurcations are supercritical; the only oscillations are stable and have small amplitude.\nSaddle-node on a limit cycle\nThe Hopf bifurcation is the best known mechanism through which one can go from a stable ﬁxed point to an oscillation. Importantly, the ﬁxed point persists through the bifurcation. Furthermore, the limit cycles which bifurcate are small amplitude and local, in the sense that it lies close to the branch of ﬁxed points (although, as we saw in the ML model, the bifurcation is subcritical at low currents and thus bifurcating periodic orbits are unstable). Another mechanism through which an oscillation can emerges from a ﬁxed point is called a saddle-node on a limit cycle or SNLC. It is also called a saddle-node inﬁnite cycle or SNIC. This is an example of a global bifurcation.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n68\n\nChapter 4. Dynamics\n\nThe behavior of the ML model with these parameters is quite diﬀerent as is seen by looking at Figure 4.5. First, unlike Figure 4.2B, the action potentials appear to occur with arbitrary delay after the end of the stimulus. Secondly, the shape of the action potentials is much less variable. The reason for this can be understood by looking at the phase plane in Figure 4.5B. Unlike the Hopf case, here there are three ﬁxed points, only one of which (labeled N ) is stable. The middle ﬁxed point is a saddle point (labeled S). Thus, the linearized system at this ﬁxed point has one positive and one negative eigenvalue. Associated with these eigenvalues are the stable and unstable manifolds. These manifolds consist of trajectories that approach the saddle point in either forward or backward time, respectively. The two branches of the unstable manifold, Σ+, form a loop with the stable node N and the saddle point S. This loop in the plane plane constrains the spike shape; since trajectories cannot cross, any trajectory starting outside the loop must remain outside of it. Thus, the spike height cannot fall below a certain level. More importantly, the stable manifold, Σ−, forms a hard threshold that is precisely determined. This contrasts with the pseudothreshold we saw in the Hopf case. Any perturbation which drives the potential to the right of Σ− results in a spike and any to the left leads to a return to rest without a spike.\nFigure 4.5 also explains the delay to ﬁring. Suppose that a stimulus drives the voltage to a point exactly on the unstable manifold Σ−. Then, the trajectory will go to the saddle point where it will remain. The closer a perturbation gets to Σ− (but to the right of it), the longer the delay to spike. Indeed, the spike with the longest delay in Figure 4.5A stays at a nearly constant voltage close to the value at the saddle-point before ﬁnally ﬁring.\nLike the Hopf case, as current is increased, the model ﬁres repetitively. A typical limit cycle is shown in Figure 4.5D. Figure 4.6A shows the bifurcation diagram as the current is increased. The steady-state voltage shows a region where there are three equilibria for Iapp between about -15 and +40. Only the lower ﬁxed point is stable. As Iapp increases, the saddle-point and the stable node merge together at a saddle-node bifurcation, labeled SN2. When Iapp = ISN2, the invariant loop formed from Σ+ becomes a homoclinic orbit; that is, it is a single trajectory that approaches a single ﬁxed point in both forward and backward time. This type of homoclinic orbit is sometimes called a saddle-node homoclinic orbit or a SNIC. As Iapp increases past Iapp = ISN2 , the saddle-point and node disappear; the invariant loop formed from Σ+ becomes a stable limit cycle. The branch of limit cycles persists until it meets with a branch of unstable periodic solutions emerging from a subcritical Hopf bifurcation.\nFigure 4.6B shows the frequency of the oscillations as a function of the current. Unlike Figure 4.4B, the frequency for this model can be arbitrarily low and there is a much greater dynamic range. Note that the nullclines in Figure 4.5C can be very close to touching each other and thus create a narrow channel where the ﬂow is extremely slow. This suggests why the frequency of ﬁring can be arbitrarily low. Moreover, as Iapp → ISN2, the limit cycles approach a homoclinic orbit. We expect that the frequency should approach zero as Iapp → ISN2 . In an exercise below, the reader shows that the frequency scales as the square root of Iapp − ISN2 and develops the theta model.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n4.4.

In both types of bifurcations, the frequency of oscillations approach zero as the current approaches the bifurcation value. However, there are important diﬀerences.\nSince φ only changes the rate of n, it has no eﬀect on the number and values of the ﬁxed points, only their stability. Figure 4.7 shows the bifurcation diagram for the model when φ is increased from 0.067 to 0.23. As before, the ﬁxed points are lost at a saddle-node bifurcation. The Hopf bifurcation on the upper branch occurs at a much lower value of current than in Figure 4.6 but the branch of periodic orbits is still subcritical. The main diﬀerence is that the stable branch of periodic orbits does not terminate on the saddle node as in Figure 4.6. Rather it terminates on an orbit that is homoclinic to one of the saddle points along the middle branch of\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n70\n\nChapter 4.

Perturbations from rest that lie in the starred region shown in C) will approach the stable limit cycles.\n\nstable manifold wraps around the spiral (in negative time). Note that the unstable manifold passes on the outside of the stable manifold. In Figure 4.8B, the stable and unstable manifolds meet and form the homoclinic orbit at Iapp = IHc. For Iapp > IHc, the unstable manifold passes inside the stable manifold and wraps around a stable limit cycle. Thus, this model has a regime of bistability where there is a stable ﬁxed point and a stable periodic orbit. Unlike the bistability in the Hopf case, the stable limit cycle does not surround the stable ﬁxed point. In the Hopf case, an unstable periodic orbit acted to separate the stable ﬁxed point from the stable limit cycle. In the present set of parameters, the stable manifold of the middle ﬁxed point separates the two stable states. In order to get onto the limit cycle, it is necessary to perturb the potential into the starred region in Figure 4.8C. Consider a brief current pulse which perturbs the voltage. If this pulse is weak, the system returns to rest. If it is very strong and passes the starred region, then the model will generate a single spike and return to rest. However, for intermediate stimuli (like the baby bear’s porridge – just right), the system will settle onto the stable limit cycle.\nFinally, we look closely at the bifurcation diagram, Figure 4.7B. Near Iapp = 38, there are two stable ﬁxed points as well as a stable limit cycle. Thus, the model is actually “tristable”. The reader is urged to explore this aspect of the model more carefully in exercise *\n\nClass I and class II\nThe ML model illustrates several important features of neuronal ﬁring. Three different mechanisms for switching from rest to repetitive ﬁring were illustrated. In particular, the most common mechanisms are through the Hopf and SNIC bifurcations. In the 1940’s Hodgkin classiﬁed three types of axons according to their properties. He called these Class I-II; with Class III being somewhere in between the ﬁrst two classes which we describe:\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n72\n\nChapter 4. Dynamics\n\nClass I. Axons have sharp thresholds, can have long latency to ﬁring, and can ﬁre at arbitrarily low frequencies;\nClass II. Axons have variable thresholds, short latency, and a positive minimal frequency.\nFrom this description, we can see that these two classes fall neatly into the dynamics of the SNIC and the Hopf bifurcations, respectively. Rinzel and Ermentrout (1989) were the ﬁrst to note this connection. Now there are many papers which classify membrane properties as Class I or Class II and mean SNIC and Hopf respectively.\nTateno et al (2004) have characterized regular spiking (RS) neurons (excitatory) and fast spike (FS) neurons (inhibitory) in rat somatosensory cortex using this classiﬁcation. (Note that many authors call the dynamics Type I,II instead of Class I,II.) Figure 4.9 show some properties of cortical neurons. RS neurons appear to be Class I; the minimal frequency is close to zero. Note that RS neurons do not seem to have subthreshold oscillations (not shown). In contrast, FS neurons appear to be Class II; they have a minimum frequency of around 15 Hz. They also exhibit subthreshold oscillations. Near the critical current, they seem to switch back and forth between rest and ﬁring. This suggests the possibility of a narrow range of bistability consistent with the subcritical Hopf bifurcation.\nT. Tateno, A. Harsch, and H. P. C. Robinson Threshold Firing FrequencyCurrent Relationships of Neurons in Rat Somatosensory Cortex: Type 1 and Type 2 Dynamics J Neurophysiol, Oct 2004; 92: 2283 - 2294.\n\n4.5 Bifurcation analysis of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations\nWe now consider the spaced-clamped Hodgkin-Huxley model (2.43). In the previous chapter, we discussed the response to a brief current pulse. Figure 2.13 shows the eﬀects of a brief current pulse at amplitudes ranging from 1-5 µA/cm2. There appears to be a very sharp transition between an action potential and a minimal response. A constant current can induce the membrane to oscillate repeatedly as seen in the right panel of Figure 2.13.\nWe can get a more global picture of the dynamics of the equations by looking at a bifurcation diagram. Figure 4.10A shows the behavior of the voltage as a function of the applied current, Iapp. Lines represent ﬁxed points and circles represent periodic orbits. The frequency of the oscillations is shown in Figure 4.10C. The range is from about 40 Hz to about 150 Hz.\nNote that there is a unique equilibrium point for all Iapp. At Iapp ≈ 10, the rest state loses stability at a Hopf bifurcation. At a large value of Iapp ≈ 154 there is another Hopf bifurcation. From the ﬁgure, it seems clear that the bifurcation is subcritical at the low current and supercritical at the high current. At the lower Hopf bifurcation, there is a subcritical branch of unstable periodic orbits. Hence, the transition from resting behavior to oscillations is Class II.\nFigure 4.10B shows a blowup of the region near this Hopf bifurcation. Evidently, there are values of Iapp near 7.88 where there are four diﬀerent limit cycles.\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n4.5.

Bifurcation diagram for the HH model. A) V versus Iapp, the applied current; B) Expanded view of A); C) Frequency as a function of current; D) (V, n)−phase plane projection showing 4 diﬀerent limit cycles.\n\nFigure 4.10D shows the projection of these limit cycles in the (V, n)−plane. Guckenheimer and Oliva (2002) provide convincing numerical evidence for chaotic behavior near this lower current value. The chaos that they compute is unstable so that it will not be observed in simulations. For large values of current, the rest-state stabilizes again through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation.\nThe apparent fact that there is a unique equilibrium point for all Iapp has never been rigorously proved for the HH equations. At equilibrium, each of the gating variables m, n and h can be written as a function of V so that we ﬁnd:\n\nIapp = g¯L(V − EL) + g¯Nam3∞(V )h∞(V )(V − ENa) +g¯Kn4∞(V )(V − EK ) ≡ F (V ).\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe statement that there is a unique equilibrium is a statement that F (V ) is monotone for all V . Since this monotonicity depends very much on the details of the steady-state gate functions, it is not likely that any general theory of the monotonicity of F exists. We leave it as an exercise to show that if |V | is large enough, then there is a unique value of Iapp for which there exists an equilibrium.\nIf we assume that the function F (V ) is monotone, then it is possible to rigorously prove the existence of the two Hopf bifurcation points. Troy (1979) proved under fairly general assumptions that there are two values of the current Iapp at which the rest state loses stability at a pair of imaginary eigenvalues. Thus, from the Hopf bifurcation theorem, he was able to conclude that there is a branch of periodic solutions emerging from the ﬁxed points. A rigorous proof of the direction\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n4.5. Bifurcation analysis of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations\n\n75\n\nof the bifurcation remains an open question. Troy’s proof relies on an analysis of the linearized equations and application\nof Hurwitz’ criteria to the characteristic polynomial. We can sketch out some of the details. Troy’s assumption that the function F (V ) is monotone implies that for each Iapp, there is a unique V that satisﬁes (4.3). Furthermore, this implies that there are never any zero eigenvalues of the linear system (see exercise ***). The linearization about the ﬁxed point leads to a matrix with a very special form. It is zero except along the diagonal, across the ﬁrst row, and down the ﬁrst column:\n\n −FV\n\nM\n\n=\n\n \n\n\n\nm′∞/τm h′∞/τh\n\nn′∞/τn\n\n−Fm −1/τm\n0\n0\n\n−Fh 0\n−1/τh 0\n\n−Fn \n\n0 0\n\n \n\n.\n\n\n\n−1/τn\n\nThe characteristic polynomial for such matrices (which are called mammillary because they resemble a mammal with many suckling babies; here the voltage is the mother and the gates are the babies) is easy to compute and the result is a fourthorder polynomial of the form:\n\nPM (λ) = λ4 + a3λ3 + a2λ2 + a1λ + a0.\n\nThe coeﬃcients are messy, but straightforward to compute. The Hopf bifurcation\noccurs when there are imaginary roots. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion provides the\nsimplest test for this condition. (see Digression). For a 4th order polynomial, there will be a Hopf bifurcation if a0 > 0, a3 > 0, a3a2−a1 > 0, and R ≡ a3a2a1−a21−a23a0 vanishes. Thus, Troy uses assumptions on the shapes of the gating functions to prove\nthat there is a Hopf bifurcation by showing that the quantity R changes sign.\n\nDigression. The Routh Hurwitz Criterion. Consider the polynomial:\n\nP (λ) = λn + an−1λn−1 + . . . a1λ + a0.\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe Routh-Hurwitz determinants provide a simple way to tell of the real parts of the roots of P are negative. We deﬁne an = 1 and aj = 0 for j > n or for j < 0. We will form a series of matrices containing the coeﬃcients aj:\n\nH1 = an−1\n\nH2 =\n\nan−1 an−3\n\n an−1 H3 =  an−3\nan−5\n\n1 an−2\n1 an−2 an−4\n\n0 an−1  an−2\n\nand so on up to Hn. Each matrix is square and the ﬁrst column contains every other coeﬃcient, an−1, an−3, . . . . The roots of P (λ) have negative real parts if an only if det Hj > 0 for j = 1, . . . , n. For example:\nn = 1. a0 > 0\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n76\n\nChapter 4. Dynamics\n\nn = 2. a0 > 0 and a1 > 0;\nn = 3. a0 > 0, a2 > 0, a1a2 − a0 > 0. n = 4. a0 > 0,a3 > 0, a3a2 − a1 > 0, a3a2a1 − a21 − a23a0 > 0. We note the following:\n• det Hn = a0det Hn−1 so that this means a0 > 0 is necessary. If a0 = 0 then there is a zero eigenvalue.\n• If det Hn−1 = 0, a0 > 0 and det Hj > 0 for j < n − 1, then there are imaginary roots.\nThese two criteria allow us to determine where possible saddle-node (eigenvalue 0) and Hopf (imaginary eigenvalues) bifurcations occur. End digression.\n\n4.6 Reduction of the HH model to a 2-variable model\nWe have seen that two-dimensional models, such as the Morris-Lecar equations, exhibit many important features of the more complicated Hodgkin-Huxley equations. The Morris-Lecar equations generate action potentials, there is a threshold for ﬁring and, depending on parameters, there are several mechanisms for the generation of oscillatory behavior. In this section, we shall describe two ways in which dynamical systems methods have been used to formally reduce the four-dimensional HodgkinHuxley model to a two-dimensional system of equations. Reduction methods will be very useful in later sections when we consider networks of neurons.\nRinzel (Federation Proceedings ??) developed a simple method based on two observations. The ﬁrst is that τm(V ), the voltage-dependent time constant for the gating variable m, is much smaller than both τh and τn. Because τm is small, m(t) is very close to m∞(V (t)). If we replace m by m∞(V ) in the voltage-equation, then this reduces the HH-model by one equation. The second observation, ﬁrst observed by Krinskii and Kokoz (1973), is that (n(t), h(t) lies nearly along a line n = b − rh where b and r are constants. Figure 4.11 shows these curves at three diﬀerent currents. The slope and the intercept depend somewhat on the current, but Rinzel ignored this. Hence, we replace n by b − rh in the voltage-equation and obtain the reduction to a two-dimensional model. We leave the analysis of this model as an exercise.\nA common method for comparing parameters which have diﬀerent units is to render the model in terms of dimensionless variables. Kepler et al (1992) describe a method for comparing the time scales of all the gating variable. Each voltagedependent gate x(t) satisﬁes an equation of the form\nx′ = (x∞(V ) − x)/τx(V ).\nThe functions x∞(V ) are monotonic, so that they are invertible. Thus, Kepler et al introduce a new variable Vx for each gate, where x(t) = x∞(Vx(t)). They obtain an\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\n"}
