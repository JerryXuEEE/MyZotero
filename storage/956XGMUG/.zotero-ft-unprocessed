Recent experiments reveal that neuronal representations of learned sensorimotor tasks continually change over days and weeks, even after animals have achieved expert behavioral performance. How is learned information stored to allow consistent behavior despite ongoing changes in neuronal activity ? What functions could ongoing reconfiguration serve? We highlight recent experimental evidence for such representational drift in sensorimotor systems, and discuss how this fits into a framework of distributed population codes. We identify recent theoretical work that suggests computational roles for drift and argue that the recurrent and distributed nature of sensorimotor representations permits drift while limiting disruptive effects. We propose that representational drift may create error signals between interconnected brain regions that can be used to keep neural codes consistent in the presence of continual change. These concepts suggest experimental and theoretical approaches to studying both learning and maintenance of distributed and adaptive population codes. \n \n    Previous article in issue \n    Next article in issue  \n \nCited by (99) \n \n    A manifold neural population code for space in hippocampal coactivity dynamics independent of place fields \n    2023, Cell Reports \n    Show abstract \n    Time and experience differentially affect distinct aspects of hippocampal representational drift \n    2023, Neuron \n    Show abstract \n    Active experience, not time, determines within-day representational drift in dorsal CA1 \n    2023, Neuron \n    Show abstract \n    Distinct ventral stream and prefrontal cortex representational dynamics during sustained conscious visual perception \n    2023, Cell Reports \n    Show abstract \n    Social odor discrimination and its enhancement by associative learning in the hippocampal CA2 region \n    2023, Neuron \n    Show abstract \n    Continuously changing memories: a framework for proactive and non-linear consolidation \n    2023, Trends in Neurosciences \n    Show abstract \n \nView all citing articles on Scopus \nView full text \n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
