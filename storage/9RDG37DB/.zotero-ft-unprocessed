They not only rationally exploit rewards but also explore an environment owing to their curiosity. However, the mechanism of such curiosity-driven irrational behavior is largely unknown. Here, we developed a decision-making model for a twochoice task based on the free energy principle, which is a theory integrating recognition and action selection. The model describes irrational behaviors depending on the curiosity level. We also proposed a machine learning method to decode temporal curiosity from behavioral data. By applying it to rat behavioral data, we found that the rat had negative curiosity, reflecting conservative selection sticking to more certain options and that the level of curiosity was upregulated by the expected future information obtained from an uncertain environment. Our decoding approach can be a fundamental tool for identifying the neural basis for reward–curiosity conflicts. Furthermore, it could be effective in diagnosing mental disorders.\n\nAnimals and humans perceive the external world through their sensory systems and make decisions accordingly1,2. Generally, they cannot make optimal decisions because of the uncertainty of the environment as well as the limited computational capacity of the brain and time constraints associated with decision-making3. In fact, they perform irrational actions. For example, people play lotteries and gamble despite low reward expectations. In this case, they face a dilemma between low expected reward and curiosity regarding whether a reward will be acquired. Thus, understanding how animals control the balance between reward and curiosity is important for clarifying the whole decision-making process. However, a method is yet to be established for quantifying the reward–curiosity balance has yet been established. In this study, we developed a machine learning method to decode the time series of the reward–curiosity balance from animal behavioral data.\nSome irrational behaviors emerge because of the strength of curiosity4,5. For example, conservative individuals avoid uncertainty and prefer to select an action that leads to predictable outcomes. Conversely, inquisitive individuals strongly desire to know the environment rather than rewards and prefer to select an action that leads to unpredictable outcomes. Too conservative and inquisitive natures can be interpreted as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit\n\nhyperactivity disorder, patients with which are known to substantially avoid and seek novel information, respectively6–14. Rational individuals fall midway between these two extremes. In an ambiguous environment, they select an action to efficiently understand the environment, and if the environment becomes clear, they select an action to efficiently exploit the rewards. Therefore, curiosity has a major impact on behavioral patterns, and it is believed that animals control the balance between reward and curiosity in a context-dependent manner.\nDecision-making has been modeled primarily by reinforcement learning (RL), which is a theory for describing reward-seeking adaptive behavior in which animals not only exploit rewards but also explore the environment. In RL, explorative behavior was addressed by a passive, random choice of action15. However, animals actively explore the environment by selecting actions that minimize the uncertainty of the environment given their curiosity.\nRecently, the free energy principle (FEP) was proposed by Karl Friston under the Bayesian brain hypothesis, in which the brain optimally recognizes the outside world according to Bayesian estimation16–18. The FEP addresses not only the recognition of the external world but also the information-seeking action selection, which minimizes the uncertainty of the recognition of the external world, known as “active\n\n1Laboratory of Data-Driven Biology, Graduate School of Integrated Sciences for Life, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. 2Kansei-Brain Informatics Group, Center for Brain, Mind and Kansei Sciences Research, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. 3Theoretical Biology Research Group, Exploratory Research Center on Life and Living Systems, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Okazaki, Japan. 4Laboratory of Theoretical Biology, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.  e-mail: nhonda@hiroshima-u.ac.jp\n\nNature Computational Science | Volume 3 | May 2023 | 418–432\n\n418\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00439-w\n\ninference”19–21. Furthermore, FEP proposed a score of action, called expected free energy, which consists of the expected reward and curiosity with the same unit22–27. Thus, action selection can be formulated by maximizing both reward and curiosity. Note that curiosity can be regarded as information gain, that is, the extent to which we expect our recognition to be updated by the new observation through the action. However, FEP assumes that the weighting of rewards and curiosity is always even and constant. Although a previous FEP study modeled active inference in a two-choice task, it assumed a constant intensity of curiosity and thus could not treat actual animal behaviors in which the weights of rewards and curiosity are expected to change over time28. Hence, conventional theories such as RL and FEP are limited in describing the conflict between reward and curiosity.\nIdentifying the temporal variability of curiosity is important for future clarifying the neural mechanisms of the reward and curiosity conflicts in decision-making. Many FEP studies have been devoted to the construction of theory, assuming that the decision-making processes of animals are Bayes optimal. Thus, there was not even the idea that animals irrationally make decisions depending on the reward and curiosity conflicts. For this reason, a method to decode the temporal balance between reward and curiosity from behavioral data is yet to be established. Such a method would enable us to analyze neural correlates with the temporal variability of curiosity, and consequently, it would help us clarify how the brain controls the balance of reward and curiosity in a context-dependent manner.\nIn this study, we extended FEP by incorporating a meta-parameter that controls the conflict dynamics between reward and curiosity, called the reward–curiosity decision-making (ReCU) model. The ReCU model can exhibit various behavioral patterns, such as greedy behavior toward reward, information-seeking behaviors with high curiosity and conservative behaviors avoiding uncertainty. Moreover, we developed a machine learning method called the inverse FEP (iFEP) method to estimate the internal variables of decision-making information processing. Applying the iFEP method to a behavioral time series in a two-choice task, we successfully estimated the internal variables, such as variations in curiosity, recognition of reward availability and its confidence.\nResults\nDecision-making with the reward–curiosity dilemma Animals perceive the environment by inferring causes such as reward availability from observation, and then they make decisions based on their own inferences. In this study, we developed an ReCU model of a decision-making agent facing a dilemma between reward and curiosity in a two-choice task, wherein the agent selects either of two choices associated with the same rewards but with different reward probabilities (Fig. 1a). If the agent aims to maximize cumulative rewards, the agent must select an option with a higher reward probability. However, in animal behavioral experiments, even after they learned which option was more associated with a reward, they did not exclusively select the best choice, but also often selected the option with a smaller reward probability, which seems unreasonable.\nHere, we hypothesized the following: Animals assume that the reward probability for each option might fluctuate over time, and therefore, the continuous selection of one option decreases the confidence of the reward probability estimation for the other option. Thus, they become curious about the ambiguous option even with a smaller reward probability, and so selecting the ambiguous option is reasonable for increasing the confidence of the estimation for both options. Therefore, we considered that the agent should make decisions driven by reward and curiosity in a situation-dependent manner.\nReCU model In the ReCU model, we divided information processing in the brain into two processes. In the first process, the agent updates the recognition of the reward probability of each option (Fig. 1a, process 1). In the second\n\nprocess, the agent selects an action based on the current recognition and curiosity (Fig. 1a, process 2). The agent repeats these two processes in the two-choice task.\nWe modeled the first process by sequential Bayesian estimation, under the assumption that reward probabilities latently fluctuate in time (Fig. 1b). The agent updates the belief about the reward probabilities, which are expressed as estimation distributions, in response to actions and consequence reward observations (Fig. 1c). We derived the equations of the belief update (Fig. 1d and Methods). We modeled the second process by action selection based on two kinds of motivations: the desires to maximize the reward and to gain the information from the environment (Fig. 1e). This sum, called ‘expected net utility’ in this study, can be expressed by\n\nUt (at+1) = E [Rewardt+1] + ct ⋅ E [Infot+1] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a and t indicate the action and trial index, respectively, and E[x] denotes the expectation value of x based on current recognition. The first and second terms represent expectations of reward and information derived from a new observation, respectively, for the next action at+1 based on current recognition. ct denotes a meta-parameter describing the intensity of curiosity, which weighs the expected information gain (see Methods for detail). We assumed an irrational mental conflict as ct varies over time (Fig. 1f). In decision-making, the agents prefer to select action at+1 with the higher expected net utility, in which the action is selected probabilistically following a sigmoidal function\n\nP (at+1)\n\n=\n\n1\n\n+\n\nexp\n\n1 (−βΔUt\n\n)\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ΔUt = Ut(at + 1) − Ut(at+1), and β denotes the inverse temperature controlling the randomness of action selection22,29,30.\n\nRecognition and decision-making in the simulation To validate our model, we performed simulations with constant curiosity ct = 1 for two cases. In the first case, where reward probabilities were constant and different between the two options (Fig. 2a), the agent preferred to select the option with the higher reward probability (Fig. 2b). The recognized reward probabilities converged to ground truths, indicating that the agent accurately recognized the reward probabilities (Fig. 2c). The recognition confidence changed over time depending on the behavior in each trial; the confidence of the selected option increased with information from the observation, whereas that of the unselected option decreased because of the agent’s assumption regarding the fluctuation in reward probabilities (Fig. 2d). Similarly, the expected information gain of an option increased and decreased when that option was selected and unselected, respectively. Thus, the expected information gain was lower for the option with higher confidence (Fig. 2e). The expected reward followed the recognized reward probability (Fig. 2f). Initially, decreasing expected information gain and increasing expected reward eventually cross at some number of trials, which correspond to switching between information exploration and reward acquisition (Supplementary Fig. 1a). These two factors are negatively correlated, indicating a trade-off relationship (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The expected net utility, which is the sum of the expected information gain and reward, represents the value of each selection (Fig. 2g), resulting in the agent’s preferentially selecting the option with the higher expected net utility.\nIn the second case, we assumed a dynamic environment with a time-dependent reward probability (Fig. 2h). In the simulation, the agent adaptively changed its recognition of the reward probability following the change in the true reward probability, and selected the option with the higher estimated reward probability (Fig. 2i,j). The confidence was affected by the uncertainty of the reward probability at each time; the confidence was high where the reward probabilities\n\nNature Computational Science | Volume 3 | May 2023 | 418–432\n\n419\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00439-w\na\nor\n\nProcess 1: recognition\n\nProcess 2: action selection\n\nRecognition process\n\nb\n\ne\n\nLatent variable\n\nwt–2\n\nwt–1\n\nwt\n\nwt+1\n\nObservation ot–2\n\not–1\n\not\n\not+1\n\nEstimate Estimate\n\nAction\n\nat–2\n\nat–1\n\nat\n\nat+1\n\nc\n\nUpdate\n\nNew\n\nbelief\nf\n\nPrevious\n\nbelief\n\nσt–1\n\nσt\n\nµt–1\n\nµt\n\nLatent variable controlling reward probability\n\nd\n\nµt = µt–1 + α Kt {ot – f(µt–1)}\n\n11\n\nσ\n\n2 t\n\n=\n\nKt\n\n+ f(µt){1 – f(µt)}\n\nCuriosity\n\nAction selection process\n\nI R\n\nRI\n\nUt(at+1) = E[Reward] + ctE[Info]\n\nR\n\nI\n\nct = ct–1 + γ noise\n\nTime\n\nFig. 1 | Decision-making model for the two-choice task with reward–curiosity dilemma. a, Decision-making in the two-choice task. Reward is provided at different probabilities for each option. The agent does not know those probabilities. Through repeated trial and error, the agent recognizes the world by inferring the latent reward probability of each option, and decides to choose the next action, that is, option, based on its own inference. b, Sequential Bayesian estimation as a recognition process.

The expected information gain of an option was negatively correlated with the confidence of the option (Fig. 2l), suggesting that the agent was curious about the uncertain option. The expected reward just varied depending on the recognized reward probability (Fig. 2m). In this case, we also observed a switching between information exploration and reward acquisition at the initial phase (Supplementary Fig. 1c). In contrast to the above case, the expected reward and expected information gain did not show clearly linear correlation because of the dynamic environment (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The expected net utility changed similarly to the expected reward; however, the difference between the left and right options was less pronounced because of\n\ncuriosity (Fig. 2n). These two demonstrations indicate that our model can represent the process of cognition and decision-making based on reward and curiosity.\n\nDiscrimination of passive and curiosity-dependent behaviors The behavioral difference based on curiosity is interesting. The expected net utility can be rewritten as\n\nΔUt = ΔE [Rewardt+1] + ct ⋅ ΔE [Infot+1] ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the first and second terms represent the differences between\nthe expected reward and information gain of two options, respectively. Thus, the agent is decided based on the balance between ΔE [Rewardt+1]\n\nNature Computational Science | Volume 3 | May 2023 | 418–432\n\n420\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00439-w\n\nand ΔE [Infot+1]. Here, we created a diagram visualizing the selected actions in the space of ΔE [Rewardt+1] and ΔE [Infot+1]. Depending on the intensity of curiosity ct, the left and right actions can be separ­ a­ ted by a boundary of ΔE [Rewardt+1] + ct ⋅ ΔE [Infot+1] = 0 (Fig. 2o–q). The agent with ct = 0 selected an option based only on ΔE [Rewardt+1] (Fig. 2p). In contrast, if ct was a nonzero value, the boundary leaned to a different direction depending on the positive and negative values of ct (Fig. 2o,q). These results indicate that passive choice (ct = 0) and curiosity-dependent choice (ct ≠ 0) can be discriminated based on the distributed pattern of selected actions in the space of ΔE [Rewardt+1] and ΔE [Infot+1].\nCuriosity-dependent irrational behaviors We examined how behavioral patterns are regulated by the intensity of curiosity and the degree of reward seeking (Fig. 3). In a scenario where the reward probabilities were zero for the left and 0.5 for the right (Fig. 3a), we simulated a model by varying the meta-parameters c and Po, which is a control parameter of the reward amount (Fig. 3b and Methods). When the agent strongly desired the reward (Po = 0.99 ) with no curiosity (c = 0), the agent preferred the right option with a higher reward probability (Fig. 3c, point a). If the agent had no desire for a reward (Po = 0.5) with high curiosity (c = 0), the agent preferred the option with a higher reward probability (Fig. 3c, point b). Although this behavior seems to be rational at first glance, the agent did not seek the reward, but rather sought the information (i.e., belief update) driven by curiosity, which resulted in a preference for the uncertain option. When the agent has negative curiosity (c = −10), the agent continuously selected either of the two options depending on the first selection (Fig. 3c, point c). In this behavior, the agent conservatively selected the more certain option, as patients with autism spectrum disorder irrationally avoid new information and repeat the same choices6–11.\nIn addition, we obtained a nontrivial result in another scenario, where the reward probabilities were 0.5 for the left and 1 for the right (Fig. 3d–f). As in the previous scenario, the agents with a strong desire for the reward (Po = 0.99, nearly equal to 1) preferred the right option with a higher reward probability (Fig. 3f, point a). The agent with no desire for reward (Po = 0.5) and high curiosity (c = 10) preferred the left option with a lower reward probability (Fig. 3f, point b). This seemingly irrational behavior was the outcome of focusing on satisfying curiosity and not seeking rewards, which recalls patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder irrationally exploring new information12–14. In addition, as seen in the previous scenario (Fig. 3c, point c), the agents with negative curiosity (c = −10), irrespective of the desire for the reward, exhibited conservative selection (Fig. 3f, point c). In combination, these results clearly indicate that behavioral patterns largely depend on the degree of conflict between reward and curiosity.\nInverse FEP: Bayesian estimation of the internal state In the above cases, we assumed a constant balance between reward and curiosity. However, our feelings swing in a context-dependent manner. Although it is important to decipher the temporal swinging of the conflict between reward and curiosity in terms of neuroscience and psychology, it is difficult to quantify the conflict because of its\n\ntemporal dynamics. Here, we addressed the inverse problem to estimate the internal states of the agent from behavioral data, known as computational phenotyping or meta-Bayesian inference31–35. To this end, we developed a machine learning method called iFEP to quantitatively decipher the temporal dynamics of the internal state including the curiosity meta-parameter from behavioral data.\nFor developing iFEP, we needed to switch the viewpoint from the agent to the observer of the agent, that is, from animals to us. In the state-space model (SSM) from the viewpoint of the agent, we described the sequential recognition of reward probabilities by the agent (Figs. 1b and 4a,b). Conversely, we developed a state-space model from the observer’s eye (the observer-SSM) to determine the internal state of the agent, for example, the intensity of curiosity ct, recognition μi,t and its confidence Pi,t (i.e., inverse of the variance of the estimation distribution) (Fig. 4c). In the observer-SSM, the intensity of curiosity was assumed to change continuously over time, and the agent’s recognition of the reward probability was updated by using the equations shown in Fig. 1c following the FEP; however, they were unknown to the observers. In addition, the agent’s actions were assumed to be generated depending on the intensity of its curiosity, recognition and confidence, as described in equation (2), but the observers can only monitor the agent’s action and the presence of a reward. In iFEP, based on the observer-SSM, we estimate the latent internal state of agent z from observation x in a Bayesian manner as\n\nP (z1∶T|x1∶T) ∝ P (x1∶T|z1∶T) P (z1∶T) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere z1∶T = {μi,1∶T, pi,1∶T, c1∶T} , x1∶T = {a1∶T, o1∶T}, and the subscript 1:T indicates steps 1 to T. In this Bayesian estimation, a posterior distribu-\ntion P (z1∶T|x1∶T) represents the observer’s recognition of the estimated z1∶T given observation x1:T with uncertainty. A prior distribution P (z1∶T)represents our belief, which is expressed as the ReCU model with the random motion of the curiosity meta-parameter c as\n\nct = ct−1 + ϵζt,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere ζt indicates the white standard Gauss noise and ϵ indicates its noise intensity. The likelihood P(x1:T|z1:T) represents the probability that x1:T was observed assuming z1:T, which also follows the ReCU model. This Bayesian estimation, namely iFEP, was conducted using a particle\nfilter and Kalman backward algorithm (Methods).\n\nValidation of iFEP with artificial data We tested the validity of the iFEP method by applying it to the artificial data generated by the ReCU model. We simulated a model agent with nonconstant curiosity in the two-choice task, where reward probabilities varied temporally. We then demonstrated that iFEP estimated the ground truth of the internal state of the simulated agent, that is, the agent’s intensity of curiosity, recognition and confidence (Supplementary Fig. 2). We also confirmed that the estimation performance is robust against the value of ϵ (Supplementary Fig. 3). Therefore, iFEP is in a position to provide efficient estimators of belief updating to clarify decision-making processing and the accompanying temporal swing in the conflict between reward and curiosity.\n\nFig. 2 | Simulations of the decision-making model. a, The two-choice task with constant reward probabilities. b, The selection probabilities for the left and right options, plotted as a moving average with window width of 101. c, The recognized reward probabilities for the left and right options compared with the ground truths depicted by dashed lines. d, The confidences of reward probability recognitions for left the and right options. e–g, The expected brief updates (e), expected reward (f) and expected net utility (g) for the left and right options. h, The two-choice task with constant and temporally varying reward probabilities for the left and right options. i–n, The same as b–g with parameter values of\n\nc = 1, Po = 0.8, α = 0.05, β = 2 and σw = 0.63. o–q, The selected options in a space of left–right differences of the expected reward and information gain.

In this experiment, once the reward probabilities were suddenly changed in a discrete manner, the rat slowly adapted to select the option with the higher reward probability (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the rat sequentially updated its recognition of the reward probability. Based on these behavioral data of the rat, iFEP estimated the internal state, that is, the intensity of curiosity, the recognized reward probabilities and their confidence levels (Fig. 5c–e). We found that the rat was not perfectly aware of the true reward probabilities but was able to recognize increases and decreases in reward probability (Fig. 5d,e). We also found that confidence increased with choice and decreased with no choice (Fig. 5f,g).\nWith iFEP, we can examine whether the rat subjectively assumed fluctuating or constant environments, that is, reward probabilities.\n\nWe estimated the degree of fluctuation of the reward probabilities the rat assumes pw = 1.785 (that is, σ2w = 0.560) from the rat behavioral data. This estimated value implied that the latent variable controlling the reward probabilities showed a random walk with increasing s.d. with trials as √σ2wt . Compared with a reward probability represented by the sigmoidal of the latent variable, the estimated reward probability can largely change from 0.5 to 0.5 ± 0.4 during only ten trials (Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, it was suggested that the rat assumed fluctuating environments and, thus, easily forgot its recognition and lost its confidence.\nNegative curiosity and its dynamics decoded by iFEP Interestingly, the curiosity held by the rat was estimated to be negative for almost all trials (Fig. 5h). In other words, the rat conservatively preferred certain choices but did not explore uncertain choices.\n\nNature Computational Science | Volume 3 | May 2023 | 418–432\n\n423\n\nArticle\n\nObserving\n\na\nObservation Action\nc\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00439-w\n\nb\n\nLatent variable\n\nzt–2\n\nzt–1\n\nzt\n\nzt+1\n\nObservation\n\not–2\n\not–1\n\not\n\not+1\n\nAction\n\nat–2\n\nat–1\n\nat\n\nat+1\n\nUpdate\nOld belief\n\nNew belief\n\nI R\n\nRI\n\nI am wondering: - How much is the reward probability? - Which option should be selected?\n\nI am wondering: - How does the agent recognize the reward probability? - How much confidence does the agent have in its recognition?\n\nIntensity of curiosity\n\nct–2\n\nct–1\n\nct\n\nct+1\n\nLatent\n\nµt–2\n\nµt–1\n\nµt\n\nµt+1\n\nvariable\n\nσ\n\n2 t–2\n\nσ\n\n2 t–1\n\nσ\n\n2 t\n\nσ\n\n2 t+1\n\nObservation\n\not–2\n\not–1\n\not\n\not+1\n\nAction\n\nat–2\n\nat–1\n\nat\n\nat+1\n\nFig. 4 | The scheme of iFEP by an observer of a decision-making agent. a, An agent performing a two-choice task from the observer’s perspective. b, The observer’s assumption about the agent’s decision-making. The agent is assumed to follow the decision-making model, as described in Fig. 1. c, The SSM\n\nof the observer’s eye. For the observer, the agent’s reward–curiosity conflict, recognized reward probabilities and their uncertainties are temporally varying latent variables, whereas the agent’s action and the presence/absence of a reward are observable. The observer estimates the latent internal states of the agent.\n\nThis negative curiosity is reasonable for the starved animals because\nanimals desired to obtain more reward with higher confidence. To\nvalidate the negative curiosity, we visualize the selected action in the space of ΔE [Rewardt+1] and ΔE [Infot+1] , as shown in Fig. 2o–q (Fig. 6a–c). When the estimated ct was negative, the rat dominantly selected the left action in a region with positive ΔE [Rewardt+1] and negative ΔE [Infot+1] (Fig. 6a for ct < −1.1; Fig. 6b for −1.1 ≤ ct < −0.7), clearly indicating that the rat has positive subjective reward and nega-\ntive curiosity. When the estimated ct was close to 0, the rat selected both actions based on ΔE [Rewardt+1] , independent of ΔE [Infot+1] (Fig. 6c for −0.7 ≤ ct ). These results clearly supported the expected net utility with positive weight for the expected reward and time-\ndependent weight for the expected information gain. In addition, we\nstatistically tested negative curiosity (P < 0.01 for Monte Carlo testing\nin Supplementary Fig. 5).\nFurther, we noticed an increase in the estimated level of curiosity at\nwhich the reward probabilities changed suddenly (Fig. 5h). This curios-\nity dynamics can be interpreted such that the rat recognized the rule\nchange and adaptively controlled the extent to which the rat sought\nnew information. We further examined how the curiosity is regulated\nby recognized environmental information. We did not detect the cor-\nrelation between the estimated curiosity and expected information\ngains (Fig. 6d,e). Moreover, we found that the temporal derivative of\n\nthe estimated curiosity highly correlated with the sum of the expected information gains for both options (Fig. 6f,g). These results implied that the rat actively upregulated the curiosity level when the uncertainty in the recognized reward probabilities increases, such as,\n\ndc dt\n\n∝\n\n∑ E [Infoi].\ni\n\n(6)\n\nEvaluations of alternative models from rat behaviors Finally, to further confirm the validity of the ReCU model, we compared it with other decision-making models based on the rat behavioral data. As an alternative version of the expected net utility, we introduced the time-dependent desire for reward as\n\nUt (at+1) = dt ⋅ E [Rewardt+1] + E [Infot+1] ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere dt denotes a meta-parameter describing subjective reward (see Methods for details). With this alternative model, the time series of dt were estimated by iFEP from the rat behavioral data. We found that the estimation of the subjective reward meta-parameter dt changed dynamically and sometimes became close to zero when the rat encountered drastic changes in the reward probabilities (Supplementary Fig. 6), which indicated that the rat suddenly no longer needed rewards.

Continuous shaded\nranges represent the s.d. for all the particles in d–h.\n\nshould be unnatural for animals that were starved before the experimental task to motivate them to obtain food. Thus, the alternative model is not suitable for describing the rat behavior.\nAnother possible model is Q-learning in the framework of RL, which has been widely used to model the decision-making tasks. Following previous studies36–38, we introduced the time-dependent inverse temperature Bt, which controls the randomness of the action selection; however, it does not lead to information-seeking behavior in the ReCU model. With the Q-learning model, we estimated time series of Bt (Methods). Then, we determined that the Bt decreased when the reward probabilities suddenly changed (Supplementary Fig. 7), meaning that the rat tends to perform a random selection of actions in response to the environmental rule change. Although this dynamic behavior\n\nof the inverse temperature seems reasonable, it is unknown how it is regulated in the Q-learning model. Here, we hypothesized that Bt could be regulated by the uncertainty of our recognition. To probe this, we compared Bt and the expected information gain, where the former was estimated based on Q-learning and the latter was estimated by iFEP in the ReCU model. We found that they are positively correlated (Supplementary Fig. 7) as\n\nBt ∝ ∑ E [Infot,i].\ni\n\n(8)\n\nTherefore, Q-learning requires a cue regarding the uncertainty of recognition, that is, the expected information gain, which supports the ReCU model for explaining the curiosity-driven behavior.\n\nNature Computational Science | Volume 3 | May 2023 | 418–432\n\n425\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00439-w\n\nProbability of selecting the right\n\na\n0.4 Right\n0.2\n\nLogistic regression\niFEP\n\nb\n0.4 Right\n0.2\n\nc\n0.4 iFEP\n0.2\n\n0.502 0.501\n\n∆ info gain\n\n∆ info gain\n\n∆ info gain\n\n0 –0.2\n\n0 –0.2\n\n0 –0.2\n\n0.500\n\n–0.4 Left\n\n–0.6 –0.4 –0.2 0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6\n\n∆ reward\n\n–0.4\n\n–0.6 –0.4\n\nLogistic regression\n–0.2 0\n\nLeft 0.2 0.4 0.6\n\n∆ reward\n\n–0.4\n\niFEP\n\nRight\n–0.6 –0.4 –0.2\n\nLogistic regression\n0 0.2\n\n∆ reward\n\n0.499\nLeft 0.498\n0.4 0.6\n\nd 1.4\n1.2\n\nInfo gain\n\nc (intensity of curiosity)\n\n1.0\n\ne 0.9\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\nCorrelation coe icient\n\nInfo gain\n\nIntensity of curiosity, c\n\n1.0\n\n–0.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\n–1.4\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\n–2.2\n\n–0.3\n\n0.4 0\nf 1.4\n1.2\n\n100 Info gain\n\n200\n\n300\n\nTrials\n\n–3.0 400\n\n0.20\n\ndc/dt (temporal derivative of curiosity)\n\n0.13\n\n–0.6 –60 –40 –20 0 20 40 60 Time lag\ng 0.9\n0.6\n\nCorrelation coe icient\n\nInfo gain\n\nTime derivative of curiosity, dc/dt\n\n1.0\n\n0.06\n\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\n–0.01\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\n–0.08\n\n–0.3\n\n0.4 0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nTrials\n\nFig. 6 | Negative curiosity and its dynamics. a–c, The selected options in a space\nof left–right differences of the expected reward and information gain.

The temporal derivative was computed by linear regression within a time window of seven trials.\n\nDiscussion\nThe advancement realized in this study is the modeling and decoding of mental conflict between reward and curiosity, which is yet to be quantified. The proposed approach can potentially improve our understanding of how mental conflict is regulated and highlight its neural mechanisms in the future by combining neural recording data.\nOur decoding approach has some limitations. The iFEP requires long trial behavioral data in the two-choice task because the particle filter needs certain trials for converging the estimation. Thus, the iFEP is not applicable to short behavioral data. In addition, the iFEP assumed gradual change in curiosity in time and cannot follow the pathologically rapid dynamics of curiosity in the estimation process of the particle filter.\nComparing the ReCU model and other models including Q-learning is difficult. In all these models, the action selection is commonly formulated with the sigmoidal function. Thus, any models can be made to fit the observed behaviors, i.e., increase likelihood, by adjusting the time-dependent meta-parameters. Therefore, model selection\n\nbased solely on likelihood is not very helpful and determining whether animals use the ReCU model or other models to make decisions seems inherently challenging. However, a potential advantage of the ReCU model is its ability to capture the dynamics of curiosity and the interplay between curiosity and reward-based learning.\nThere is a related theoretical model, which differs from RL and FEP. Ortega and Braun formulated FEP, which describes irrational decision making39,40. Interestingly, their formulation was based on microscopic thermodynamics and the temperature parameters controlled this irrationality. However, the thermodynamics-based FEP did not treat the sequential update of the recognition from the observations.\nFinally, it is worth discussing future perspectives of our iFEP approach in medicine. In general, mental diagnosis relies on medical interviews and has not been evaluated quantitatively. Our iFEP method can quantitatively estimate the psychological state of patients based on their behavioral data. For example, patients with social withdrawal, also known as ‘Hikikomori,’ have no interest in anything. In this case, social withdrawal would be characterized by a negative value of curiosity in\n\nNature Computational Science | Volume 3 | May 2023 | 418–432\n\n426\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00439-w\n\nour FEP model. Therefore, the iFEP method could be considered effective for diagnosing mental disorders.\n\nMethods\nAmount of reward In the two-choice task, the reward is given as all-or-none; however, its intensity depends on the agent’s own feeling as\n\nR\n\n=\n\n0\n\nor\n\nln\n\nPo 1−Po\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Po represents the desired probability of how much the agent wants the reward and controls the reward intensity felt by the agent (Supplementary Fig. 8). In Friston’s formulation, the presence and absence of rewards are given by log preference with natural unit as ln Po and In(1 − Po), which take negative values22,23. In this equation, the reward is the difference between log preferences to ensure that the reward intensity is positive.\n\nwhere φt = {μt, respectively (μt\n\nΛ=t}(,μa1,tn, μd2,μt)tTa; nΛdt\n\nΛt denote the = diag (p1,t, p2,t))\n\nmean and precision, . Q (wt|φt) denotes the\n\nrecogn­ ition distribution. The model agent aims to update the recog­\n\nnition distribution through φt at each time step by minimizing\nthe surprise, which is defined by − ln P (ot|o1∶t−1). The surprise can be decomposed as follows:\n\n− ln P (ot|o1∶t−1)\n\n=\n\n∫Q (wt|φt) ln\n\ndw Q(wt |φt )\n\nP(ot ,wt |o1∶t−1 ,a1∶t )\n\nt\n\n−KL [Q (wt|φt) ||P (wt|o1∶t, a1∶t)] ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere KL [q (x) ||p (x)] denotes the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the probability distributions q(x) and p(x). Because of the\nnonnegativity of KL divergence, the first term is the upper bound of\nthe surprise:\n\nState space model for reward probability recognition The agent assumed that the reward is generated probabilistically from the latent cause w, and probabilities λi are represented by\n\nλi = f (wi) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere i indicates the indices of the options and f (x) = 1/ (1 + e−x) . In addition, the agent assumed an ambiguous environment\nin which the reward probabilities are fluctuated by a random\nwalk as\n\nwi,t = wi,t−1 + σwξi,t,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere t, ξi,t , and σw denote the trial of the two-choice task, standard Gaussian noise and the noise intensity, respectively. Thus, the agent\nassumes an environment expressed by an SSM as\n\nP (wt|wt−1) = 𝒩𝒩 (wt|wt−1, σ2wI) ,\n\n(12)\n\nF (ot, φt) = ∫Q (wt|φt) ln Q (wt|φt) dwt + ∫Q (wt |φt) J (ot, wt) dwt, (17)\n\nwhich is called the free energy, where J (ot, wt) = − ln P (ot, wt|o1∶t−1, a1∶t). The first term of the free energy corresponds to the negative entropy\nof a Gaussian distribution:\n\nF1 = ∫Q (wt|φt) ln Q (wt |φt) dwt.\n\n(18)\n\nThe second term is approximated as F2 = ∫Q (wt |φt) J (ot, wt) dwt\n\n≅\n\n∫Q (wt|φt) {J (ot, μt) +\n\ndJ dw\n\n(wt\n\n− μt) +\n\n1 2\n\nd2 J dw2\n\n(wt\n\n− μt)2} dwt\n\n(19)\n\nP (ot|wt, at) = ∏ [f (wi,t)ot {1 − f (wi,t)}1−ot ]ai,t ,\ni\n\n(13)\n\nwhere wt and ot denote the probabilities of both options\n\nlatent at step\n\nvariables controlling the reward t (wt = (w1,t, w2,t)T) and the observa-\n\ntion of the presence of the reward (ot ∈ {0, 1}), respectively. Meanwhile,\n\nat denotes the agent’s action at step t, which is represented by a one-hot vector (at ∈ {(1, 0)T , (0, 1)T}) , 𝒩𝒩 (x|μ, Σ) denotes the Gaussian distribu-\n\ntion mean μ and variance Σ, σ2w denotes the variance of the transition probability of w, I denotes an identity matrix, and f(wi,t) = 1/(1 + e−wi,t ),\n\nwhich represents the probability of the reward of option i at step t. The\n\ninitial distribution of w1 is given by P (w1) = 𝒩𝒩 (w1|0, κI), where κ denotes variance.\n\n=\n\nJ (ot, wt)|wt=μt\n\n+\n\n1 2\n\nd2 J dw2\n\n||wt =μt\n\nΛ−t 1.\n\nNote that E (ot, wt) is expanded by a second-order Taylor series\naround μt. At each time step, the agent updates φt by minimizing F (ot, φt).\n\nCalculation of free energy The free energy is derived as follows: F1 simply becomes\n\nF1\n\n=\n\n1 2\n\nln 2πp−1,t1\n\n+\n\n1 2\n\nln 2πp−2,1t\n\n+ const.\n\n(20)\n\nFor computing F2,\n\nFEP for reward probability recognition We modeled the agent’s recognition process of reward probability using sequential Bayesian updating as\nP (wt|o1∶t, a1∶t) ∝ P (ot|wt, at) ∫P (wt|wt−1) P (wt−1|o1∶t−1, a1∶t−1) dwt−1. (14)\n\nP (ot, wt|o1∶t−1, a1∶t) = P (ot|wt, at) ∫P (wt|wt−1) P (wt−1|o1∶t−1, a1∶t−1) dwt−1\n≅ P (ot|wt, at) ∫P (wt|wt−1) N (wt−1|μt−1, Λ−t−11) dwt−1. (21)\n\nBecause of the non-Gaussian P(ot|wt, at), the posterior distribution of wt, P (wt|o1∶t, a1∶t) , becomes non-Gaussian and cannot be calculated analytically. To avoid this problem, we introduced a simple posterior\ndistribution approximated by a Gaussian distribution:\n\nQ (wt|φt) = 𝒩𝒩 (wt|μt, Λ−t 1) ≒P (wt|o1∶t, a1∶t) ,\n\n(15)\n\nIn the second line of this equation, we use the approximated recognition distribution as the previous posterior P (wt−1|o1∶t−1, a1∶t−1)  . This equation can be written as\nP (ot, wt|o1∶t−1, a1∶t) ≅ ∏ [f (wi,t)ot {1 − f (wi,t)}1−ot ]ai,t N (wi,t|μi, t−1, p−i, t1 + σ2w) .\ni\n(22)\n\nNature Computational Science | Volume 3 | May 2023 | 418–432\n\n427\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00439-w\n\nThen where\n\nE (ot, wt)|wt=μt = J1 (ot, μ1,t) + J2 (ot, μ2,t) + const., Ji (ot, μi,t) = ai,t [ot ln f (μi,t) + (1 − ot) ln {1 − f (μi,t)}]\n\n−\n\n1 2\n\n(μi,t −μi,t−1 )2 p−i,t1 +σ2w\n\n−\n\n1 2\n\nln (p−i,t1 + σ2w) .\n\nwhich is a rewriting of equation (17). Here, we attempt to express the\nfuture free energy at time t + 1, conditioned on action at +1 as (23)\nF (ot+1, at+1) = EQ(wt+1|φt) [ln Q (wt+1|φt) − ln P (ot+1, wt+1|o1∶t, a1∶t+1)] . (32)\n\nHowever, there is an apparent problem in this equation: ot+1 has not yet been observed because it is a future observation. To resolve this issue, (24) we take an expectation with respect to ot+1 as\n\nF (at+1) = EQ(ot+1|wt+1,at+1)Q(wt+1|φt) [ln Q (wt+1|φt) − ln P (ot+1, wt+1|o1∶t, a1∶t+1)] .\n\n(33)\n\nThus, F2 is calculated by substituting this equation into equation (19).

The free energy\nat current time t is described by\n\nF (ot, φt) = EQ(wt|φt) [ln Q (wt|φt) − ln P (ot, wt|o1∶t−1, a1∶t)] ,\n\n(31)\n\nThis can be rewritten as\n\nF (at+1) = EQ(ot+1,wt+1|o1∶t,at+1) [ln Q (wt+1|φt) − ln P (wt+1|o1∶t+1, a1∶t+1) − ln P (ot+1|o1∶t, a1∶t+1) ]\n\n(34)\n\nAlthough P (ot+1|o1∶t, a1∶t+1) can be computed by the generative model as\n\nP (ot+1|o1∶t, a1∶t+1) = ∫P (ot+1|wt+1, a1∶t+1) P (wt+1|o1∶t) dwt+1 ≅ ∫P (ot+1|wt+1, a1∶t+1) Q (wt+1|φt) dwt+1,\n\n(35)\n\nit is assumed that P (ot+1|o1∶t, a1∶t+1)  was heuristically replaced with P (ot+1) as the prior agent’s preference of observing ot+1 , so that ln P (ot+1)can be addressed as an instrumental reward. The equation (34)\nwas further transformed into\n\nF (at+1) = EQ(ot+1|at+1)Q(wt+1|o1∶t+1,at+1) [ln Q (wt+1|φt) − ln Q (wt+1|o1∶t+1, a1∶t+1) − ln P (ot+1) ] .\n\n(36)\n\nFinally, we obtained the so-called expected free energy as\n\nF (at+1) = EQ(ot+1|at+1) [−KL [Q (wt+1|ot+1, at+1) ||Q (wt+1)] − ln P (ot+1)] . (37)\n\nwhere the KL divergence is called a Bayesian surprise, representing the\nextent to which the agent’s beliefs are updated by observation, whereas the second term ln P (ot+1) can be addressed as the agent’s prior preference of observing ot+1, which can be interpreted as an instrumental reward. Therefore, the expected free energy is derived in an ad hoc\nmanner.\nIn the first term of equation (30), the posterior and prior distribu-\ntions of wt+1 in the KL divergence are derived as\n\nQ (wt+1) = ∫P (wt+1|wt) Q (wt) dwt,\n\n(38)\n\nQ (wt+1|ot+1,at+1) =\n\n, P(ot+1 |wt+1 ,at+1 )Q(wt+1 |at+1 )\nP(ot+1 |at+1 )\n\n(39)\n\nrespectively. ot+1 is a future observation, and therefore, the first term was expected by P (ot+1|at+1), which can be calculated as\n\nP (ot+1|at+1) = ∫P (ot+1|wt+1, at+1) Q (wt+1|at+1) dwt+1.\n\n(40)\n\nIn the second term, the reward is quantitatively interpreted as the desired probability of ot+1. For the two-choice task, we use\n\nP\n\n(ot+1 )\n\n=\n\nPot+1\no\n\n(1\n\n−\n\nPo )(1−ot+1 )\n\n,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere Po indicates the desired probability of the presence of a reward. According to the probabilistic interpretation of reward22,23,\n\nNature Computational Science | Volume 3 | May 2023 | 418–432\n\n428\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00439-w\n\nthe presence and absence of a reward can be evaluated by ln Po and ln(1 − Po), respectively.\nIn this study, we changed the sign of the expected free energy as the expected net utility, because we modeled decision-making as the maximization of the expected free energy. We ventured to introduce the curiosity meta-parameter ct to express irrational decision-making. Because rewards are relative, in this study, we set ln {Po/ (1 − Po)} and 0 for the presence and absence of a reward, respectively. Thus, our expected net utility can be described by equation (30), in which there is a gap between the original expected free energy and our expected net utility.\n\nModel for action selection The agent probabilistically selects a choice with higher expected net utility as\n\nP (at+1) =\n\nexp(βU(at+1 )) ∑a exp(βU(a))\n\n,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere U (at+1) indicates the expected net utility of action at+1. Equation (42) is equivalent to equation (2). To derive equation (42), we\nconsidered the expectation of the expected net utility with respect to\nprobabilistic action as\n\nE [U] = EQ(at+1) [U (at+1) − β−1 ln Q (at+1)] ,\n\n(43)\n\nwhere β indicates an inverse temperature, and the entropic constraint of action probability is introduced in the second term. This equation can be rewritten as\n\nE [U] = −β−1KL [Q (at+1) ‖ exp (βU (at+1)) /Z] + β−1 ln Z,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere Z indicates a normalization constant. Thus, its maximization\nrespective to Q (at+1) leads to the optimal action probability as shown in equation (42).\n\nH (ot+1|wt+1) = −EQ(wt+1|at+1) [∑i ai,t+1g (wi,t+1)] ,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere\n\ng (w) = f (w) ln f (w) + (1 − f (w)) ln (1 − f (w)) .\n\n(50)\n\nHere, we approximately calculate this equation by using the second-order Taylor expansion as\n\nH\n\n(ot+1 |wt+1 )\n\n≅\n\n−EQ(wt+1 |at+1 )\n\n⎡⎢⎢⎢∑i ⎣\n\nai,t+1\n\n⎧⎪ ⎨⎪⎩\n\ng\n\n(μi,t+1 )\n\n+\n\n∂g ∂wi,t+1\n\n(wi,t+1\n\n−\n\nμi,t+1 )\n\n+\n\n1 2\n\n∂2 g ∂w2i,t+1\n\n(wi,t+1\n\n− μi,t+1)2\n\n⎫⎪⎬⎪⎭⎤⎥⎥⎥⎦\n\n,\n\n(51)\n\nwhich leads to\n\nH (ot+1|wt+1) =\n\n−\n\n∑\ni\n\nai,t+1\n\n⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢ ⎣\n\n+\n\n1 2\n\nf (μi,t+1) lnf (μi,t+1) + (1 − f (μi,t+1)) ln (1 − f (μi,t+1))\n\n{f\n\n(μi,t+1\n\n)\n\n(1\n\n−\n\nf\n\n(μi,t+1\n\n))\n\n(1\n\n+\n\n(1\n\n−\n\n2f\n\n(μi,t+1\n\n))\n\nln\n\nf(μi,t+1 ) 1−f(μi,t+1\n\n)\n\n)}\n\n(p−i,t1 + p−w1)\n\n⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥. ⎦\n\n(52)\n\nThe marginal entropy H (ot+1) can be calculated as\n\nH (ot+1) = − ∑ ai,t+1 {P (ot+1 = 0|at+1) ln P (ot+1 = 0|at+1) ,\ni\n+P (ot+1 = 1|at+1) ln P (ot+1 = 1|at+1)}\n\n(53)\n\nwhere\n\nP (ot+1|at+1) = ∫P (ot+1|wt+1, at+1) Q (wt+1|at+1) dwt+1\n\nAlternative expected net utility For comparison, we consider an alternative expected net utility by intro­ ducing a time-dependent meta-parameter in the second term as follows:\n\n= ∫∏ {f (wi,t+1)ot+1 (1 − f (wi,t+1))1−ot+1 }ai,t+1 Q (wt+1|at+1) dwt+1\ni\n\nU (at+1) = EP(ot+1|at+1) [KL [Q (wt+1|ot+1, at+1) ||Q (wt+1|at+1)]] + dt ⋅ EP(ot+1|at+1) [R (ot+1)] ,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere dt denotes the subjective intensity of reward at time t. In this case, the agent with high dt will show more exploitative behavior, whereas the agent with dt = 0 shows more explorative behavior driven by the expected information gain.\n\nCalculation of expected net utility Here, we present the calculation of the expected net utility.

This is depicted graphically in Fig. 4. As prior information, we assumed that the agent acts based on the internal state, that is, the intensity of curiosity, the recognized reward probabilities and their confidence levels. The intensity of curiosity was assumed to change temporally as a random walk:\n\nct = ct−1 + ϵζt,\n\n(56)\n\nNature Computational Science | Volume 3 | May 2023 | 418–432\n\n429\n\nArticle\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00439-w\n\nwhere ζt denotes white noise with zero mean and unit variance, and ϵ denotes its noise intensity.

Thus, we approximated P (zt|x1∶t) as 𝒩𝒩(zt|mt, Vt), where mt and Vt denote a sample mean and a sample variance of the particles at t, whereas we linearized\nP (zt|zt−1, θ) as\n\nP (zt|zt−1, θ) ≅ 𝒩𝒩 (zt|Azt−1 + b, Γ) ,\n\n(69)\n\nA=\n\n||| , ∂F(zt−1,at−1)\n\n∂zt−1\n\nmt\n\n(70)\n\nb = F (mt, at−1) − Amt,\n\n(71)\n\nwhere A denotes a Jacobian matrix.

These equations contain the time-dependent meta-parameters, that is, ct and βt. For both models, the goodness of fit (that is, likelihood) for the actual behavioral data can be freely improved by tuning the time-dependent meta-parameters. Thus, discrimination between the ReCU and Q-learning models must be essentially impossible.\n\nEstimation of parameters in iFEP The ReCU model has several parameters: σ2w, α, β, Po and ϵ. In the estimation, we set ϵ to 1, which was the optimal value for estimation in the artificial data (Supplementary Fig. 3). We assumed the unit intensity\nof reward, that is, ln Po/(1 − Po) = 1, because it is impossible to estimate both Po and β caused by multiplying β and ln Po/(1 − Po) in the expected net utility (equations (30) and (42)). This treatment is suitable for rela-\ntive comparison between the curiosity meta-parameter and the reward. In addition, we addressed βct as a latent variable as ĉt = βct because of the multiplication of β in the expected net utility (equations (30)\nand (42)). Thus, the estimation of ct can be obtained by dividing the estimated ĉt by the estimated β. Therefore, the hyperparameters to be estimated were σ2w, α and β.\nTo estimate these parameters θ = {σ2w, α, β} , we extended the observer-SSM to a self-organizing SSM44 in which θ was addressed as\nconstant latent variables:\n\nP (zt, θ|x1∶t) ∝ P (xt|zt) ∫P (zt|zt−1, θ) P (zt−1, θ|x1∶t−1) dzt−1,\n\n(78)\n\nwhere P (θ) = Uni (σ2|aσ, bσ) Uni(α|aα, bα)𝒩𝒩𝒩β|mβ, vβ). To sequentially calculate the posterior P (zt, θ|x1∶t) using the particle filter, we used 100,000 particles and augmented the state vector of all particles by\nadding the parameter θ, which was not updated from randomly sam-\npled initial values.\nThe hyperparameter values used in this estimation were μ0 = 0, σ2μ = 0.012, ag = 10, bg = 0.001, au = −15, bu = 15, aσ = 0.2, bσ = 0.7, aα = 0.04, bα = 0.06, aβ = 0 and bβ = 50, which were heuristically given as parameters\ncorrectly estimated using the artificial data (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nStatistical testing with Monte Carlo simulations Supplementary Fig. 5 shows statistical testing of the negative curiosity estimated in Fig. 5. A null hypothesis is that an agent has no curiosity (that is, ct = 0) decides on a choice only depending on its recognition of the reward probability. Under the null hypothesis, model simulations were repeated 1,000 times under the same experimental conditions as in Fig. 5 and the curiosity was estimated for each using iFEP. We adopted the temporal average of the estimated curiosity as a test statistic and plotted the null distribution of the test statistic. Compared with the estimated curiosity of the rat behavior, we computed the P value for a one-sided left-tailed test.\n\nReporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nSource data for Figs. 2, 3, 5 and 6 are available with this paper.
