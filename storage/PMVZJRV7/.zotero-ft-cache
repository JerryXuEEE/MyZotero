These functions are considered to originate from complex functional interactions among the brain regions belonging to the RSNs13. However, the level of complexity that is observed in the activities of an ensemble of brain regions and in the structure of these functional interactions has not been quantified for the RSNs. As a result, it remains challenging to comprehensively understand this ensemble brain activity as an integrative largescale neural system14,15. For microscopic neural tissues, maximum entropy models (MEMs) have been successful in estimating the complexity of neural activity patterns. For example, the pairwise MEM method (that is, a second-order model) seeks to fit a relatively simple binary-state model containing up to second-order interaction terms (that is, firing rates and pairwise interaction) to empirical data of spatiotemporal spike trains. If the pairwise MEM is accurately fitted to the data, activity patterns of neurons can be described with a combination of averaged activity at each recording site and pairwise correlation. If it does not, we cannot ignore higher-order interactions such as triplet interactions originating from an external common input, and accurate descriptions of the activity patterns of neurons would require more complicated (that is, higher-order) MEM models. In fact, the pairwise MEM accurately describes firing patterns in the retinal tissues of primates recorded electrophysiologically in vitro16â€“21, firing patterns and local field potentials (LFPs) in human cortical tissues in vitro22 and large-scale firing patterns in the visual cortex of monkeys and cats in vivo23,24. These findings suggest the possibility that the human brain activity patterns during rest are not so complex and can be accurately described by pairwise MEMs. If the pairwise MEM accurately explains large-scale brain activity patterns during rest, the MEM method will give us much richer information about functional interactions in the RSNs than the widely used functional connectivity (FC) analysis, which is based on Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient between a pair of brain regions. Although FC often implies broader classes of methods for inferring connectivity in the brain, we use this term to refer to the methods on the basis of Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient in this paper. The FC-based analysis (based on Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient) has successfully revealed that specific functional connexions are enhanced during specific cognitive processes25,26, and the FC map serves as a promising indicator of several diseases27,28, stages of development29,30 and levels of intelligence31. However, because FC is calculated as Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient between activities of pairs of regions3,4, the FC-based method is founded on the implicit assumption that the pairwise interactions are independent of each other32. If different pairwise interactions influence each other, the observed correlation between regions A and B may be a natural consequence of, for example, the correlation between regions A and C and that between regions B and C. In fact, a study employing monkeys shows that, even when a pair of brain regions does not have a direct anatomical connexion, the FC between them is often large if the regions receive common input from a third region33. Other studies also show that a significant FC value between a pair of regions does not distinguish a direct (that is, monosynaptic) connexion from an indirect (that is, polysynaptic) connexion34,35. The FC-based methods may discard possibly rich information that would be revealed if we take into account that functional interactions influence each other8. Unlike the functional interactions estimated by the FC-based method, functional interactions estimated by the pairwise MEM method are not a simple collection of pairwise interactions that are determined independently of each other. The method infers organization of functional interactions based on global activity patterns (that is, activities of more than two sites that are considered simultaneously), not on the assumption that activity patterns of region pairs are independent of those of other pairs. Therefore, if the pairwise MEM can accurately describe the RSNs, the MEM method is expected to provide a better method for assessing integrative network structure than the FC-based method. In the present study, we first quantify the complexity inherent in activities of an ensemble of brain regions during rest by fitting the MEM to resting-state fMRI data in the RSNs. Then, to validate the approximation of the RSNs by the pairwise MEM, we demonstrateâ€</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F12200618%2Fitems%2FNN2C9NV9%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Watanabe et al., 2013, p. 2</span>)</span>
