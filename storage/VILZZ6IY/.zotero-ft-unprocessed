This advantage can be attributed principally to the use of elementary physical phenomena as computational primitives, and to the representation of information by the relative values of analog signals rather than by the absolute values of digital signals. This approach requires adaptive techniques to mitigate the effects of component differences. This kind of adaptation leads naturally to systems that learn about their environment. Large-scale adaptive analog systems are more robust to component degradation and failure than are more conventional systems, and they use far less power. For this reason, adaptive analog technology can be expected to utilize the full potential of wafer-scale silicon fabrication.< > \nPublished in: Proceedings of the IEEE ( Volume: 78 , Issue: 10 , October 1990 ) \nPage(s): 1629 - 1636 \nDate of Publication: October 1990 \nISSN Information: \nINSPEC Accession Number: 3807284 \nDOI: 10.1109/5.58356 \nPublisher: IEEE \nAuthors \nReferences \nCitations \nKeywords \nMetrics \nMore Like This \nVLSI Analog Circuit Fault Diagnostic Correlation Coefficient Analytical Method \n \n2009 IEEE Circuits and Systems International Conference on Testing and Diagnosis \n \nPublished: 2009 \nUsing neural net architectures in analog circuits \n \n2007 50th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems \n \nPublished: 2007 \nShow More \nReferences \nReferences is not available for this document. \nIEEE Personal Account \n \n    Change username/password  \n \nPurchase Details \n \n    Payment Options \n    View Purchased Documents  \n \nProfile Information \n \n    Communications Preferences \n    Profession and Education \n    Technical interests  \n \nNeed Help? \n \n    US & Canada: +1 800 678 4333 \n    Worldwide: +1 732 981 0060 \n    Contact & Support  \n \nFollow \n \nAbout IEEE Xplore | Contact Us | Help | Accessibility | Terms of Use | Nondiscrimination Policy | IEEE Ethics Reporting | Sitemap | IEEE Privacy Policy \n \nA not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. \n \nÂ© Copyright 2023 IEEE - All rights reserved. \nPDF Help \n"}
