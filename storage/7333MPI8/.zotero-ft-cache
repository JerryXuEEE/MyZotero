Background

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become increasingly popular during the last decades mainly driven by the antidepressant effects of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation with “butterfly” coils. Only recently, alternative targets such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) have been brought into focus and innovative coil designs such as the angled geometry of the double cone coil (DCC) have raised hope to reach even deeper located targets.
Objective

To provide a systematic and comprehensive review on the application of rTMS stimulation of the dmPFC using the DCC in neuropathological and healthy samples.
Methods

We systematically searched the MEDLINE® database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ ). Due to the heterogeneous naming of DCC stimulation over the dmPFC a variety of search terms was applied resulting in a numeral quantity of 340 hits.
Results

DCC stimulation over the dmPFC has been proven to be safe and feasible in various neuropsychiatric disorders and in healthy subjects. Clinical results are encouraging, but have to be considered as preliminary as data from sham-controlled clinical trials and knowledge about the neurobiological underpinnings are still scarce.
Conclusion

DCC stimulation over the dmPFC represents a promising approach in the fast evolving noninvasive brain stimulation techniques aiming at the functional modulation of brain areas vitally involved in affect, sensory autonomic, cognitive, and salience regulation. This may hold potential for both neuroscientific research and clinical applications in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

    A high-density theta burst paradigm enhances the aftereffects of transcranial magnetic stimulation: Evidence from focal stimulation of rat motor cortex
    2022, Brain Stimulation
    Citation Excerpt :

    Notably, compared to the sham control groups, the efficacy of TMS treatment in these early clinical trials were modest, and have remained disappointingly moderate in the years that followed [4,5]. Many approaches have been reported to enhance the effectiveness of TMS treatment, including patient stratification [6,7], stimulation targets beyond dlPFC [8,9], more condensed TMS treatment sessions [10], multisite stimulation [11,12], and new TMS coil designs that can access deeper brain structures [13,14], etc. From a technical perspective, TMS employs a brief but strong magnetic field pulse, inducing electrical stimulation in the brain (a few thousand amperes and a few thousand volts) [15].

    Symptom dimensions to address heterogeneity in tinnitus
    2022, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews
    Citation Excerpt :

    High frequency (5−20 Hz) repetitive TMS (rTMS) and anodal tDCS increase cortical excitability and low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS and cathodal tDCS reduce cortical excitability. Low and high frequency rTMS over the temporoparietal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal cortex modifies cortical excitability, resulting in temporary suppression of tinnitus (Chung et al., 2012; Kleinjung et al., 2005; Kreuzer et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2013; Mennemeier et al., 2011; Rossi et al., 2007). Anodal tDCS over the left temporoparietal cortex (Garin et al., 2011; Shekhawat et al., 2013), bifrontal (Vanneste and De Ridder, 2011; Vanneste et al., 2010b) and bilateral tDCS over the auditory cortex (Joos et al., 2014) suppresses tinnitus loudness and distress.

    Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with borderline personality disorder: A systematic review
    2021, Psychiatry Research
    Citation Excerpt :

    This is an important technical characteristic, since angulations less than 180 ° allow the ends of the "butterfly wings" coil to have a more tangential position to the skull, and theoretically, the efficiency increases (Rossi et al., 2009). Similarly, the use of double cone coils, such as the Cool D-B80 coil, allows direct stimulation of deeper brain regions, induces a more robust and less focal electric field relative to a "classical" 180° figure-eight coil (Kreuzer et al., 2019). Most studies conducted delivered rTMS as an add-on therapy to a variety of pre-existing pharmacological treatments, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, lithium, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, or a combination of them.

    Rapid computation of TMS-induced E-fields using a dipole-based magnetic stimulation profile approach
    2021, NeuroImage
    Citation Excerpt :

    To illustrate the capability of the MSP to approximate different coil types we used models of two commercially available TMS coils (MagVenture Cool-B35 and Cool D-B80). The Cool-B35 is a highly focal small-diameter coil whereas the Cool D-B80 offers high depth penetration so in this sense they represent extreme cases that one might encounter for practical studies (Cortes et al., 2013; Ishkhanyan et al., 2020; Kreuzer et al., 2019; Pavon et al., 2019). We calculated the incident and total E-fields of the coils using the BEM-FMM solution as a ground truth and compared the consistency with the MSP dipole basis approximation visually.

    High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex for negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial
    2021, Psychiatry Research
    Citation Excerpt :

    Our proposed rTMS protocol was referred to a number of studies over the world, and was used safely in the treatment of a variety of diseases, including depression(Schulze et al., 2016), chronic stroke(Sasaki et al., 2017), eating disorder(Woodside et al., 2017), and substance dependent(Hanlon et al., 2015). Recently, a review proved that DMPFC-rTMS was safe and feasible in various neuropsychiatric disorders and in healthy subjects (Kreuzer et al., 2018). Our study reported the safety of DMPFC-rTMS treatment for patients with schizophrenia for the first time.
