Although it is the most commonly used anesthetic in the world, much remains unknown about the mechanisms by which it induces a loss of consciousness. Characterizing anesthesia-induced alterations to brain network activity might provide a powerful framework for understanding the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness.\nThe aim of this work was to model brain activity in healthy brains during various stages of consciousness, as induced by propofol, in the auditory paradigm. We used the generalized Ising model (GIM) to ﬁt the empirical fMRI data of healthy subjects while they listened to an audio clip from a movie. The external stimulus (audio clip) is believed to be at least partially driving a synchronization process of the brain activity and provides a similar conscious experience in diﬀerent subjects. In order to observe the common synchronization among the subjects, a novel technique called the inter subject correlation (ISC) was implemented.\nWe showed that the GIM—modiﬁed to incorporate the naturalistic external ﬁeld—was able to ﬁt the empirical task fMRI data in the awake state, in mild sedation, in deep sedation, and in recovery, at a temperature T∗ which is well above the critical temperature. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst study that captures human brain activity in response to real-life external stimuli at diﬀerent levels of conscious awareness using mathematical modeling. This study might be helpful in future to assess the level of consciousness of patients with disorders of consciousness and help in regaining their consciousness.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe brain is a complex system, characterized by heterogeneous networks of structural connections supporting cognition, and which assist in responding to perceptual information coming from the peripheral nervous system. Modern neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and EEG, now permit the comprehensive mapping of these networks in order to understand how information is transmitted within and across them (Abreu et al., 2018). However, many aspects of the dynamical functioning of the brain under stimulation and in altered states of consciousness induced by anesthetic drugs are still not completely understood (Hudetz, 2012). Using engaging stimuli that drive a speciﬁc conscious\n\nexperience (such as, for example, watching a movie) would make it possible to detect whether behaviourally unresponsive patients are having a comparable conscious experience.\nAnesthetics generally suppress the body’s normal automatic functions, such as breathing, the heartbeat, and blood pressure, as well as the global cerebral metabolic rate (Will and Berg, 2007). Using EEG, it has been shown that low-frequency, high amplitude oscillations increase as the level of anesthesia increases (Hagihira, 2015). A number of neuroimaging studies have probed the eﬀects of anesthesia-induced sedation on brain activation when exposed to various types of acoustic inputs. Using propofol, a short-acting medication that results in a decreased level of consciousness that is widely used due to its fast in-\n\n∗ Corresponding author: Sivayini Kandeepan.

Gomez et al.\nduction and recovery time (Tobias and Leder, 2011), Naci et al. found a high cross-subject correlation between sensory-driven auditory cortex in higher-order frontal and parietal regions while listening to a plot-driven audio story while participants were conscious. During deep anesthesia, however, the cross-subject correlation was limited to the auditory cortex, and was almost abolished in fronto-parietal regions (Naci et al., 2014). Davis and colleagues also found that bilateral temporal-lobe responses to complex auditorily-presented sentences were preserved when reduced levels of awareness were induced via propofol (Davis et al., 2007). These ﬁndings were further conﬁrmed by Dueck et al., who presented musical stimuli to neurosurgical patients after the injection of diﬀerent concentrations of propofol (Dueck et al., 2005). Their study showed activation in the superior temporal gyrus (primary and secondary auditory cortex) and in higher-order auditory information processing areas while participants were awake. These activations attenuated with increasing concentrations of propofol but remained partially preserved in the superior temporal gyrus. Additionally, in an auditory word listening fMRI study of functional connectivity, Liu et al. reported that propofol-induced sedation disrupted verbal comprehension and memory by blocking the projection of sensory information to higher‐order processing networks and thus preventing information integration (Liu et al., 2012).\nNeuroimaging techniques have allowed us to explore how the brain functions at diﬀerent levels of consciousness, in both healthy individuals and in patients. However, there are many hypotheses that would be diﬃcult or impossible to directly test using brain imaging. Computational models allow us to simulate the brain in diﬀerent states and under diﬀerent conditions, allowing us to test such hypotheses. One such model, the Ising model developed by Ernest Ising, has been adapted from its traditional use in describing the behaviour of magnets to be applied in computational neuroscience (Fraiman et al., 2009; Schaub and Schultz, 2012). Spin sites capture the dynamics of the BOLD signal with a two-state spin variable, representing activity above and below a baseline. By simulating the Ising model at diﬀerent temperatures, Fraiman et al. showed that, at the critical temperature Tc (the temperature at which the system exhibits a transition from an ordered phase to a disordered phase), the model can simulate the global behavior of the brain’s functional connectivity at rest (Fraiman et al., 2009). They showed that the best ﬁt to the distribution of the functional correlations of the brain was obtained from the simulations at the critical temperature of the 2D classical Ising model.\nThe generalized Ising model (GIM), which was introduced by Marinazzo and colleagues (Marinazzo et al., 2014), is a modiﬁcation to the 2D classical Ising model, in which spins are no longer restricted to interact with only their neighbours, but may interact with all other spins via diﬀering coupling strengths (Marinazzo et al., 2014). In the classical Ising model, spins of the lattice do not correspond to a particular region of the brain, however in the generalization of the Ising model, each brain region corresponds to a particular spin in the lattice site. Accordingly, the structural connectivity matrix Jij, which gives the coupling strength between two regions in the model, is built such that it corresponds to the number of white matter ﬁbers between each pair of regions of the brain obtained using diﬀusion tensor imaging (DTI). Because we have parcellated the brain into 84 regions, Jij is an 84 × 84 matrix and the couplings are normalized in such a way that the highest coupling has a value of one. Considering this one-to-one relationship between the spin sites and the brain regions, this model can be used to simulate the BOLD activity either during resting state (spontaneous activity) or while engaged in a task.\nThe GIM has been recently employed to simulate resting state fMRI (Abeyasinghe et al., 2018; Das et al., 2014; Deco et al., 2012; Fraiman et al., 2009; Marinazzo et al., 2014; Stramaglia et al., 2017). Implementing the GIM on two diﬀerent resolutions of structural connectivity matrices, Marinazzo et al. showed that the total information transfer between the spins, deﬁned by the Shannon entropy, was maximized at criticality (Marinazzo et al., 2014). Further, Stramaglia and colleagues\n\nNeuroImage 223 (2020) 117367\ncompared the correlations between spin sites simulated from the Ising model implemented on the structural connectome against the empirical functional brain correlations both at the single link level (in which spin sites are ﬂipped one at a time) and at the modular level (in which blocks of correlated spin sites are ﬂipped together). They concluded that when the brain is under anesthesia, similarity between the model and empirical data increases at the modular level (Stramaglia et al., 2017).\nContinuing work to optimize the GIM, Deco et al. studied the Ising model implemented on artiﬁcially created structural connectomes with diﬀerent coupling strengths among the nodes (Deco et al., 2012). By examining the entropy of the system at diﬀerent coupling strengths, they found that the system exhibited rich dynamics when the structural connections of the brain self-organized to form a scale-free network. Such a network is characterized by many nodes with high connections (i.e., hubs), following a power-law degree distribution. They are called scalefree, as power laws have same functional form at any scale. Finally, Abeyasinghe et al. (Abeyasinghe et al., 2018) calculated the dimensionality of the brain with respect to information transfer during wakefulness, using the GIM, and reported it to be two. In their work, dimensionality was explained in terms of the reactivity of neurons to stimuli, that is, neurons specialized to react to certain stimuli were low dimensional, while neurons that react to mixed stimuli were highly dimensional. In order to calculate dimensionality, they introduced a concept for the distance between two regions in the GIM to be equivalent to the inverse of the normalized ﬁber connections between the two regions (which is relevant to the information transfer), as there is no direct measure to calculate the distance between the two regions in the GIM.\nThe goal of the present study was to provide an initial step to see if the GIM can be applied to assess the common neural experience a behaviourally non responsive patient might have. To do this, we modelled the brain activity of healthy subjects using the GIM implemented on the structural architecture, in altered states of consciousness, while receiving a naturalistic external stimulus. We predicted that the brainbehaviour response to naturalistic stimuli would be more complex to model compared to stimuli presented in a block design. This study in future might provide an alternative way to measure the awareness of a non-responsive patient and help in restoring their consciousness.\n2. Methodology\nThe data of 17 healthy subjects were acquired while participants were listening to the audio clip (task condition) as well as while they were at rest, at four levels of sedation. Data were then preprocessed and parcellated into 84 regions of interest (ROIs), and the empirical time series of each ROI was extracted. The GIM was then simulated at different temperatures under resting and task conditions, and simulated time series were obtained. Empirical and simulated inter-subject correlations were calculated using the respective time series, and they were then compared to ﬁnd the temperature that led to the highest degree of similarity. Details of each step are given below.\n2.1. Participants\n17 healthy volunteers (4 women; mean age 24 years, SD = 5) participated in this study. All were right-handed, native English speakers, and had no history of neurological disorders, and were recruited via printed advertisements posted on the university campus and through word of mouth. All volunteers provided informed consent after completing an MRI and propofol safety screening questionnaire provided by both the attending MR technician and anesthesiologist, to conﬁrm that they understood study risks and did not have any contraindications for MRI or sedation. Volunteers were remunerated for their time. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board and Psychology Research Ethics Board of Western University (REB #104,755).\n\nS. Kandeepan, J. Rudas and F. Gomez et al.\n2.2. Task Protocol\nFMRI scans were acquired while participants listened to the audio story in four states of consciousness: awake, mild sedation, deep sedation, and recovery. The audio story was played at the start of each session once the wakefulness/sedation level was assessed. The audio story was 5 min in duration and was an excerpt from a scene of the movie ‘Taken’ (reported in Naci et al., 2015) that portrays a teenage girl being kidnapped (Naci et al., 2017). This audio story was chosen because it is richly evocative and highly arousing as well. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board and Psychology Research Ethics Board of the University of Western Ontario. Written informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from the subjects. The data used in this study will be available in Openneuro.org.\n2.3. Administration of propofol\nBefore entering the fMRI scanner, a 20 G i.v. cannula was inserted into a vein on the dorsum of the non-dominant hand of the participants. The propofol infusion system was connected to the cannula prior to the ﬁrst scanning session. Intravenous propofol was administered with a Baxter AS 50 (Singapore). An eﬀect-site/plasma steering algorithm was used in combination with the computer-controlled infusion pump to achieve step-wise increments in the sedative eﬀect of propofol. The infusion pump was adjusted to achieve the desired level of sedation, guided by targeted concentrations of propofol, as predicted by the TIVATrainer (the European Society for Intravenous Aneaesthesia, eurosiva.eu) pharmacokinetic simulation program. The pharmacokinetic model provided target-controlled infusion by adjusting infusion rates of propofol over time to achieve and maintain the target blood concentrations as speciﬁed by the Marsh 3 (Marsh et al., 1991) compartment algorithm for each participant, as incorporated in the TIVATrainer software.\nThe four states of consciousness were deﬁned as follows. 1) Awake: No propofol was administered during the “awake” session. During the awake scan, prior to the administration of propofol, participants were fully awake, alert, and communicating appropriately. 2) Mild sedation: At the beginning of the mild sedation scan, propofol infusion commenced with a target eﬀect-site concentration of 0.6 μg/ml and oxygen was titrated to maintain SpO2 above 96%. Once the baseline target eﬀect-site concentration was reached, the participants’ level of sedation was assessed and if deemed to be appropriate for mild sedation (Ramsey 3), the eﬀect-site concentration was maintained. During administration of propofol, participants became calmer and more slowed in their response to verbal communication. Once participants stopped engaging in spontaneous conversation, and speech became sluggish, they were classiﬁed as a Ramsey level 3 and were considered mildly sedated. At this level, participants only responded to loud commands. 3) Deep sedation: Prior to commencing the deep sedation scan, the target eﬀectsite concentration was again increased in increments of 0.3 μg/ml with repeated assessments of responsiveness. Once a Ramsey 5 level of sedation was achieved, no further changes were made, and the participant was maintained at that level. When participants stopped responding to verbal commands and were only rousable to light physical stimulation, they were considered Ramsey level 5 and deeply sedated. Patients were unable to engage in conversation at this level. At Ramsay 5, participants remained capable of spontaneous cardiovascular function and ventilation. 4) Recovery: Propofol was discontinued following the deep sedation scan and approximately 11 min following the discontinuation of propofol, participants reached Ramsey level 2. This was observed by clear and quick responses to verbal commands.\nThe mean estimated eﬀect-site propofol concentration was 2.48 (1.82–3.14) μg/ml, and the mean estimated plasma propofol concentration was 2.68 (1.92–3.44) μg/ml. Mean total mass of propofol administered was 486.58 (373.30–599.86) mg. The variability of these concentrations and doses is typical for studies of the pharmacokinetics and\n\nNeuroImage 223 (2020) 117367\npharmacodynamics of propofol (Nimmo et al., 2019; Sukumar et al., 2018 ).\n2.4. Sedation Assessment\nPrior to acquiring fMRI data, three independent assessors (two anesthesiologists and one anesthesia nurse) evaluated each participant’s Ramsay level by communicating with them in person inside the fMRI scanner room. Participants were also asked to perform a basic verbal recall memory test and a computerized (4 min) auditory target detection task, which further assessed each individual’s wakefulness/sedation level independently of the anesthesia team. Scanning commenced only when the agreement among the three anesthesia assessors on the wakefulness/sedation level was conﬁrmed.\n2.5. fMRI Data acquisition\nNoise cancellation headphones (Sensimetrics, S14; www.sens.com) were used for sound delivery at a volume level deemed comfortable by each individual for the duration of the experiment. Functional echoplanar images were acquired (33 slices, voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm3, interslice gap of 25%, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, matrix size = 64 × 64, FA = 75°). The audio story and resting state scans had 155 and 256 vol, respectively. An anatomical scan was obtained using a T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE (Magnetization Prepared - RApid Gradient Echo) sequence (32 channel coil, voxel size: 1 × 1 × 1 mm3, TE = 4.25 ms, matrix size = 240 × 256 × 192, FA = 9°).\n2.6. Preprocessing of fMRI data\nT1 images were preprocessed using the SPM (http:www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/ fslwiki/), SimpleITK (http://www.simpleitk.org/) and Dipy (http:// nipy.org/dipy/) toolboxes. T1 preprocessing included manual removal of the neck, brain extraction using FSL, correction of low-frequency intensity non-uniformity based on the N4 (non-parametric non-uniform normalization) bias ﬁeld correction algorithm from SimpleITK, image denoising based on non-local means algorithm from Dipy, and spatial normalization to standard stereotactic Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the SPM12 normalization algorithm. The initial three volumes of the fMRI data were discarded to avoid T1 saturation eﬀects. Head motion and slice timing corrections were performed on the fMRI data using FSL, followed by artifact correction using RapidArt (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/rapidart/). Subsequently, fMRI data were coregistered to a T1 image using SPM12 (http:www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and spatially normalized to MNI space using the SPM12 normalization algorithm. Finally, spatial smoothing of the fMRI data was performed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width at half maximum as implemented in SPM12.\n2.7. fMRI Signal extraction based on parcellation\nFirst, the average time series of each region inside the AAL2 parcellation (Hagmann et al., 2008) scheme (http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/ tools/aal-aal2/) was extracted. The extracted time series were then cleaned by removing spurious variance via the regression of nuisance waveforms derived from the average time series obtained from regions of non-interest (white matter and cerebrospinal ﬂuid). This nuisance regressor also included six motion parameters (translation and rotation parameters in the x, y, and z dimensions) from a rigid body transformation previously estimated using FSL. Finally, the time series were detrended, ﬁltered using a bandpass with a Butterworth ﬁlter of cut-oﬀ frequencies set at 0.01 Hz and 0.1 Hz, and standardized to have zero mean and unit variance across time.\n\nS. Kandeepan, J. Rudas and F. Gomez et al.\n2.8. Extraction of features from the audio clip\nThe spins of the GIM were coupled with the external ﬁeld (i.e., the audio clip) via diﬀerent coupling strengths. The coupling strengths were obtained by performing a general linear model (GLM) between the audio clip and the time series, using the audio clip as the independent variable and the time series of each region as the dependent variables. The coeﬃcients calculated from the GLM represented the coupling strengths of each spin with the external ﬁeld. Using the combination of the coupling strengths and the audio clip as the external stimulus, the GIM was simulated. However, the inter-subject correlation (will be discussed in Section 2.9) calculated from the simulated data was not able to ﬁt the inter-subject correlation calculated from the empirical data at any temperatures. Therefore, more meaningful time and frequency domain features were extracted from the audio clip to simulate the GIM as follows.\nThe audio clip was sampled at 44.1 kHz for a duration of 5 min. Twenty-one audio features from both the time and frequency domains were extracted from the original audio clip using the software pyAudioAnalysis (https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis/) (Giannakopoulos, 2015). In this extraction we only considered the audio features relevant in describing an engaging scene of a movie. Therefore, we did not extract other features which describe the melodic characteristics of music such as the chroma vector or chroma deviation, obtained from this pyAudioAnalysis software. The three time-domain features were: zero crossing rate (rate of sign changes along a signal), energy (sum of squares of the signal values, normalized by the respective frame length) and entropy of energy (measure of abrupt changes), which were directly extracted from the raw signal samples. The eighteen remaining features were in the frequency domain, obtained from the Fourier transform of the audio signal, and consisted of spectral centroid (center of gravity of the spectrum), spectral spread (second central moment of the spectrum), spectral entropy (entropy of the normalized spectral energies for a set of sub-frames), spectral ﬂux (the squared diﬀerence between the normalized magnitudes of the spectra of the two successive frames), spectral roll oﬀ (the frequency below which 90% of the magnitude distribution of the spectrum is concentrated) and thirteen Mel frequency cepstral coeﬃcients (MFCCs). MFCCs are coefﬁcients that collectively make up a Mel frequency spectrum and oﬀer a description of the spectral shape of the sound (Giannakopoulos, 2015). Here, the frequency bands are positioned logarithmically (on the Mel scale), which more closely approximates the human auditory system’s perceived response or pitch than do the linearly-spaced frequency bands. The audio signal was divided into time frames with lengths of two seconds without overlap, to match the repetition time of the fMRI data, and the above-mentioned audio features were extracted using the average of each frame. Finally, a multicollinearity test was performed on these 21 extracted features after they were normalized between −1 and 1, using a function called “variation inﬂation factor” implemented in RStudio. This function determined that three features had higher collinearity and could therefore be removed, while the remaining 18 features were used in the generalized linear modelling.\n2.9. Inter-Subject Correlation\nInter-Subject Correlation (ISC) has been used previously to examine highly complex fMRI data acquired during naturalistic stimulation, such as when watching a movie (Hasson et al., 2004; Kauppi et al., 2010; Pajula et al., 2012). ISC measures the common neural activity present across subjects by comparing their neural response time series over the course of the naturalistic stimulation. The main advantage of ISC analysis over conventional fMRI analysis is that it does not require a priori knowledge of the external stimulus to locate activated brain areas. In ISC analysis, the subject’s brain response to naturalistic stimuli is used to predict the brain responses within other subjects. Therefore, it is a model-free approach and is useful in measuring the synchronization across brains, induced by the real-life stimulus.\n\nNeuroImage 223 (2020) 117367\n\nHere, in order to calculate the ISC of the empirical data, the time\n\nseries from each ROI was initially extracted from the preprocessed fMRI\n\ndata using the method described in Sections 2.6 and 2.7, and normalized\n\nsuch that the highest value was ±1. Pearson correlations between every\n\npair of subjects were calculated for each ROI using the formulae given\n\nin Eq. (1) and then averaged (𝑟̄) over the number of pairs using Eq. (2).\n\n∑𝑁\n𝑛 =1\n\n[( 𝑆 𝑖 [ 𝑛 ]\n\n−\n\n𝑆 𝑖\n\n)( 𝑆 𝑗\n\n[ 𝑛 ]\n\n−\n\n𝑆 𝑗\n\n)]\n\n𝑟 𝑖𝑗\n\n=\n\n√ ∑𝑁\n𝑛 =1\n\n( 𝑆 𝑖 [ 𝑛 ]\n\n−\n\n𝑆 𝑖\n\n)2\n\n∑𝑁\n𝑛 =1\n\n( 𝑆 𝑗\n\n[ 𝑛 ]\n\n−\n\n𝑆 𝑗\n\n)2\n\n(1)\n\n𝑟̄ =\n\n(\n\n1 )\n𝑚2 −𝑚 2\n\n∑𝑚\n𝑖 =1\n\n∑𝑚\n𝑗 =2 ,𝑗 >𝑖\n\n𝑟 𝑖𝑗\n\n(2)\n\nwhere rij is the correlation coeﬃcient between the time series of the ith and jth subjects, N is the total number of samples in the time series, Si and Sj are the time series obtained from ith and jth subjects, respectively,\n𝑆𝑖and 𝑆𝑗 denote the means of Si and Sj and m is the total number of subjects (in our case, m = 17). Then, in order to test for the statistical signiﬁcance of 𝑟̄, null re-sampling distribution was generated by circu-\nlarly shifting the time series of each subjects by a random number. Then\nthe re-sampled rij values were calculated. Afterwards, a t-test between the distributions of the original rij values and the re-sampled rij values of each ROI was performed. Results of the t-tests were Bonferroni cor-\nrected for multiple comparisons (McDonald, 2009) with a signiﬁcance level of p < 0.01 to acquire only the signiﬁcant 𝑟̄-values. The ISC of the\nresting and task data was calculated for all four levels of consciousness,\nand plotted on a brain map using MATLAB.\n\n2.10. Generalized Linear modelling\n\nGeneralized Linear Modelling (GLM) coeﬃcients were used as an input to simulate the GIM. GLM was performed using the 18 audio features (P(t)) that survived the multicollinearity test as the independent variables, and the empirical time series as the dependent variable to obtain the coeﬃcients. The coeﬃcients represent the coupling of the external stimulus with the spin sites and we refer to the collective coeﬃcients (84 in our case) of all the ROIs as the ẞ-map. The GLM was repeated on all subjects’ empirical data to obtain their ẞ-maps for each audio features. A one-sample t-test was then performed on the audio features using the subjects’ ẞ-maps to obtain the t-scalar maps for each audio features. Only those t-values possessing a p < 0.01 were used to generate the external stimulus to be used in the GIM. The external stimulus for each condition (awake, mild sedation, deep sedation, recovery) was calculated via Eq. (3):\n\n∑ 𝑁 𝑝\n\n𝐻𝑖(𝑡) = 𝑃 𝑘(𝑡)𝑡𝑘𝑖\n\n(3)\n\n𝑘 =0\n\nwhere Hi(t) is the external stimulus applied onto ith region, Np is the total number of predictors (=18 in our case), 𝑡𝑘𝑖 is the threshold t-value of the region i for the kth predictor, obtained from the t-test among the ẞ-values, Pk(t) is the time series of the kth predictor and 𝑃 0 = 1. This\nHi(t) was then used as the external stimulus while simulating the GIM.\n\n2.11. Generalized Ising model simulation\n\nThe GIM used an initial 1-D random spin conﬁguration with 84 spins in either the +1 or −1 state, and was in contact with a thermal bath of temperature T. The energy of the spin conﬁguration during spontaneous activity (resting) and non-spontaneous activity (with external stimulus) are given by Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively:\n\n∑𝑁\n\n𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡 = −\n\n𝐽𝑖𝑗 𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑗\n\n(4)\n\n𝑖,𝑗;𝑖≠𝑗\n\n∑𝑁\n\n∑𝑁\n\n𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 = −\n\n𝐽𝑖𝑗 𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑗 − 𝐻𝑖(𝑡)𝑠𝑖\n\n(5)\n\n𝑖,𝑗;𝑖≠𝑗\n\n𝑖\n\nS. Kandeepan, J. Rudas and F. Gomez et al.\n\nwhere Jij is the coupling constant between the ith and the jth site (i.e., the number of ﬁbers connecting two regions, normalized between 0 and\n\n1), Si and Sj are the spins of the ith and jth site, and N (=84) is the total number of spin sites. The Jij was obtained from the averaged DTI data of 69 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The Metropo-\n\nlis Monte Carlo (MMC) algorithm was employed to simulate the system.\n\nIn order to minimize the energy of the spin conﬁguration using the MMC\n\nalgorithm, the following steps were performed: 1. A random initial con-\n\nﬁguration with 84 spins was generated and the initial energy (Ein) was calculated. 2. A randomly selected spin was ﬂipped, and the new en-\n\nergy (Enew) was calculated. 3. If Enew < Ein, the spin ﬂip was accepted, the new conﬁguration became the new initial conﬁguration with energy\n\nEin = Enew, and the simulation was continued from step 2. 4. If Enew >\n\nEin, the Boltzmann factor 𝐵 =\n\n𝑒𝑥 𝑝 −\n\nΔ𝐸 𝑘𝐵 𝑇\n\nwas calculated and a random\n\nnumber r between 0 and 1 was drawn. If B > r, the spin was accepted,\n\nEin was replaced with Enew, and the procedure was repeated from step 2. Alternatively, if B < r, the ﬂip was rejected, and the simulation was\n\nstarted over from step 2. These simulations were repeated from step\n\n2 until an equilibrium condition with minimal ﬂuctuations around the\n\nequilibrium energy was reached. Once the system was allowed to equili-\n\nbrate, the equilibrium energy (E), magnetization (M) and susceptibility\n\n(𝜒) were calculated using Eqs. (4)–(7):\n\n𝑀\n\n=\n\n1 𝑁\n\n|\n\n∑𝑁\n𝑖 =1\n\n𝑆 𝑖 |\n\n(6)\n\n𝜒=\n\n1 𝑁𝑇\n\n[ 𝑀\n\n2\n\n−\n\n𝑀\n\n2 ]\n\n(7)\n\nSimulation for one time-point in the GIM was considered equivalent after N x N x 10 (where N is the number of spins) number of ﬂips had been performed. Previous work has empirically shown that with this number of steps, equilibrium will be reached and therefore the thermodynamic properties can be calculated (Abeyasinghe et al., 2018; Fraiman et al., 2009). The time taken to perform this number of spin ﬂips was considered to be equivalent to 2 s (one time-point) of the audio clip, as TR = 2 s. By repeating these steps to equal number of time points of fMRI data, each time conﬁrming the equilibrium condition, the simulated time series were obtained.\nThe GIM was simulated for the resting (H(t) = 0) and task conditions (H(t) ≠ 0) using the external stimulus H(t) described in Section 2.10. This procedure was repeated for 250 diﬀerent temperatures ranging from 0.025 to 6 (unit-less), and at each temperature, the thermodynamic properties such as the energy, magnetization and susceptibility were calculated. The simulations were performed 17 times, using different initial conﬁgurations to resemble 17 subjects, for all four levels of consciousness. Next, assuming that the temperature across the subjects was identical, the ISC was calculated on the generated time series for each of the 250 temperatures. The ISC maps calculated from the simulated time series were then plotted at the critical temperature (the temperature that maximized susceptibility), and the temperature that minimized the distance between the empirical and simulated ISC (i.e., the temperature that gave the best ﬁt between the empirical and simulated ISC) which was calculated using Kolmogrove-Smirnov test (KStest) statistic. The temperature at which this happens was considered as our best ﬁt between the empirical and simulated ISC.\nThe null distribution for the ISC was generated in two ways; 1) by randomly permuting the Jij and simulating the GIM using the same coupling terms 2) by randomly permuting the coupling terms and simulating the GIM using the un-permuted jij. Then, to look at the eﬀects in the ISC due to the alterations in both jij and coupling terms, Pearson correlation coeﬃcients between the empirical ISC and simulated ISC at T∗ were obtained.\n\n3. Results\nFig. 1 shows the ISC obtained from the empirical data for all four levels of consciousness, while the subjects were listening to the audio\n\nNeuroImage 223 (2020) 117367\nclip. Overall, a clear pattern of synchronization, which decreased with levels of unconsciousness and increased during the recovery stage was seen, consistent with what has been found previously (Boveroux et al., 2010; Jordan et al., 2013). In the awake condition, synchronization amongst participants’ brain activity in the fronto-parietal, auditory, and language areas was observed. Synchronization amongst participants in the frontal-parietal area diminished in the mild and deep sedation conditions, but returned back to its original level during recovery. However, synchronization in the auditory regions remained during unconsciousness, with lower values, similar to results found in prior studies (Naci et al., 2018). In contrast, synchronization amongst participants’ brain regions was not observed at any levels of consciousness during the resting conditions (i.e., when not listening to the audio clip).\nResults obtained from the GIM simulations using the empirical data are presented in the following sections. Fig. 2 displays the variation of the thermodynamic properties during rest and under stimulation for sedated and non-sedated conditions. Plotted values are the mean of 17 simulations along with their standard deviations. The standard deviation at rest is very small and cannot be seen in the plots.\nCritical temperatures in each condition were obtained using the maximum of the susceptibility curves shown in Fig. 2 and are plotted in Fig. 3. Overall, the critical temperature during stimulation shifted towards lower temperature values compared to the resting condition. During stimulation, the critical temperatures increased from awake to mild sedation, and further increased from mild to deep sedation; it then decreased during recovery and reached similar critical value as that of the awake state. However, during all four levels of consciousness, the critical temperature at rest remained the same at a value of 1.41. At rest, Tc did not change, as it depended only upon the input Jij. In contrast, under stimulation, while we used the same Jij for all levels of consciousness we derived diﬀerent t-maps to model the modulation of the anaesthetic on the diﬀerent brain regions’ interaction with the external ﬁeld. Because Tc depends on both the structural connectivity (Jij) and the interaction of the spins with the external ﬁeld, a change in Tc was observed for diﬀerent levels of consciousness.\nFig. 4 depicts the distance between the normalized empirical and simulated ISC for the task data, calculated using the KS-test. The sub criticality (T < Tc), super criticality (T > Tc), and Tmin (the temperature that minimizes the distance between the correlation matrices of empirical and simulated data) values are deﬁned as published in Abeyasinghe et al. (Abeyasinghe et al., 2018). The criticality (Tc) is far lower than T∗, the temperature that minimizes the distance between the empirical and simulated ISC. From the results, we can conclude that in order to reach T∗, the system should be in a super critical state.\nNormalized eighteen audio features extracted from the 5-minute audio clip of the movie “Taken” using pyAudio Analysis, along with the intensity of the original audio clip is shown in Appendix A. These audio features were then used in the GLM to calculate the ẞ-values and then ﬁnally the t-maps (Appendix B). From the Appendix B, it can be seen that some of the MFFCs (P8, P9, P11, P13) are properly capturing the auditory perception at each level of consciousness which was observed in the empirical data (Appendix B). MFCCs are frequencysmoothed log-magnitude spectra derived from a sinusoidal-based expansion of the energy spectrum, and demonstrate good representation of speech signals or of human hearing. These coeﬃcients suppress undesirable spectral variation, particularly at higher frequencies, and therefore may be capturing useful acoustic properties related to auditory perception.\nThe ISC calculated from the simulated data under auditory stimulation using the GIM in the awake, mild sedation, deep sedation, and recovery conditions are displayed in Fig 5. At all four levels of consciousness, at criticality the ISC increases, but at a temperature distant from criticality in the super critical regime (T∗), the ISC of the simulated data closely resembled that of the empirical data. In the awake state, the primary auditory, frontal, and language regions synchronized in the empirical data are again synchronized at T∗. Moreover at T∗ there\n\nS. Kandeepan, J. Rudas and F. Gomez et al.\n\nNeuroImage 223 (2020) 117367\n\nFig. 1. ISC calculated from the empirical task data at four diﬀerent levels of consciousness.\n\nwere regions that showed synchronization among subjects that was not present in the empirical data. For example, in the simulated data, a paradoxical eﬀect of an increase in synchronization was seen in the motor area of the left hemisphere during mild sedation and a synchronization in the right inferior parietal in deep sedation. Further the correlation between the empirical ISC and simulated ISC maps at T∗ for awake, mild sedation, deep sedation and recovery were 0.80, 0.87, 0.61 and 0.83 respectively.\nWhen the GIM was simulated using the permuted Jij, and permuted coupling strengths obtained from the task condition, the temperature at which the best ﬁt between the empirical and simulated ISC (T∗) varied from the original values, i.e. before permuting the Jij and coupling terms. Correlation values calculated between the empirical ISC and simulated ISC at T∗ in diﬀerent conditions is shown in Table 1. It can be seen that, in all conditions, permuting beta values highly reduced the correlation values, while permuting the Jij did not change much the correlation values. These results indicate that although a contribution from the jij is seen in the ISC, the majority of the contribution comes from the coupling terms between the spins and the external ﬁeld. Ideally having the scrambled data would have permitted to test the null distribution accurately using diﬀerent coupling strengths obtained from these data.\n\n4. Discussion\nFMRI studies indicate that neuronal responses are more ecologically valid under naturalistic conditions than under conventional laboratory conditions using artiﬁcial stimuli (Hasson et al., 2010). Naturalistic paradigms, with the aid of engaging movies or narratives, capture and sustain attention more easily than artiﬁcial stimuli or task designs (Naci et al., 2014). Therefore, we investigated the capability of the GIM to ﬁt fMRI data obtained during a naturalistic audio listening task at diﬀerent levels of consciousness as induced by propofol. The GIM was simulated using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm to obtain equilibrium spin conﬁgurations when an external stimulus (i.e. an audio clip) was applied, and the ISC at diﬀerent temperatures was calculated to ﬁnd the best ﬁt to the empirical ISC.\nPrimary auditory, language, and the fronto-parietal regions belonging to the executive control network appear to have strong ISC amongst the participants during the awake and recovery states (Fig. 1, 5). These ISC values diminish during sedation in the empirical and simulated task data. However, in the sedated condition, ISC was present only in primary auditory regions but with smaller values. This is consistent with these regions’ roles in auditory perception and processing external information from the environment, such as listening to a story. Previous\n\nS. Kandeepan, J. Rudas and F.

Loss of information processing in the fronto-parietal regions reveals that complex auditory processing in the higher-order networks—such as the executive control network—is suppressed, but with a reduced amount of processing in the lower-order networks—such as the auditory network—during unconsciousness.\nWhen the brain is auditorily stimulated in the real world, some features of the audio signal negatively couple to certain regions of the brain,\n\nwhile other features positively couple with certain brain regions. This, in turn, moves the system towards a disordered state, shifting the criticality to a lower value as seen in Fig. 2. This may allow the brain to engage only on the necessary regions, and to respond to external stimulation in an eﬀective way. In this case, external stimulation does not behave as a source of order—aligning all the spins in the system in one direction—but appears to behave as a source of disorder.\nUnder stimulation, critical temperatures during unconsciousness (i.e., deep sedation) moved closer to the spontaneous criticality; and,\n\nS. Kandeepan, J. Rudas and F. Gomez et al.\n\nNeuroImage 223 (2020) 117367\nFig. 3. Critical temperature variation during resting and under stimulation at four diﬀerent levels of consciousness.\n\nconversely, when participants were conscious, they moved away from spontaneous criticality toward a lower temperature (Fig. 3). When the external stimulus was presented during deep sedation, the system was less aﬀected, and therefore remained closer to the spontaneous criticality, due to the low coupling strengths of the spins with the external stimulus. This is because the t-values were small and, therefore, the system resembled spontaneous activity, having a critical value signiﬁcantly closer to that of the spontaneous situation (Fig. 3). On the other hand, t-values were bigger while participants were under stimulation while awake or in recovery, and therefore pushed the system further away from spontaneous criticality, as depicted in Fig. 3. The eﬀect of the audio clip on the awake and recovery states was stronger than in the deep anesthesia state, and the criticality can be considered a measure of the engagement in the story.\nFraimann et al. (Fraiman et al., 2009) had stated that the brain functions at criticality during wakeful rest. However, an ongoing debate concerns whether the brain does indeed function at criticality, and some controversial results were reported by Bédard et al. (Bedard et al., 2006), and Dehghani et al. (Dehghani et al., 2012), using recordings in animals and humans. They had performed avalanche dynamics studies on humans, cats and monkeys using EEG, and reported a lack of power-law scaling, a characteristic of critical behavior, in both awake and sleep states. Our results indicate that when an external stimulus is applied, dynamics show a departure from criticality towards the super-critical state as observed in Fig. 4. Temperature was used as a ﬁtting parameter in order to match conditions in the real brain. Here, the T∗ does not only depend on the input Jij, but also depends on how the external stimulus couples with the spins. At rest, Tc is a good approximation and T∗ does not move much away from Tc, as there is no ISC. But under stimulation, the ISC constrains the model and T∗ moves away from Tc to a higher temperature.\nIn the Ising model, temperature (T) acts like a thresholding mechanism to maximize the ISC between empirical and simulated data. As T is increased, spins that are mildly coupled with the external ﬁeld lose their coupling, because the thermal energy provided by the temperature overcomes the interaction between the spins and the external ﬁeld. This reduces synchronization amongst participants. However, spins that are strongly coupled with the audio clip, for example spins corresponding to auditory regions, still retain their coupling with the ﬁeld despite the increase in temperature. At Tc, most of the spins are coupled with the\n\nexternal ﬁeld, producing a high level of synchronization on all spins amongst participants, which is not reﬂective of the empirical data. But at T∗, only the necessary spins are coupled to the external ﬁeld, while the other spins are decoupled with the external ﬁeld. This leads to synchronization in the necessary regions giving the best match with the empirical data. In all four conditions under stimulation, it became necessary to move away from criticality into the super-critical state to ﬁnd the best match with the empirical task fMRI data (Fig. 4).\nAn increase in brain activity due to stimulation changes the sensitivity of neuronal inputs and, therefore, the brain may be dynamically moved into diﬀerent states (Hesse and Gross, 2014) and also may be conﬁned (Ponce-Alvarez et al., 2015) to adapt brain functions of momentary demands. Moreover, some studies have proposed that an external time-varying input may give rise to power-law avalanche distributions, and the larger networks can be restored when the avalanches within the modules are further pushed into the supercritical regime (Dahmen et al., 2019). When the brain is exposed to a signiﬁcant level of external input, self-tuning mechanisms of the brain might try to regulate the activity down. This will make the system to depart from criticality, in which the internally generated dynamics was optimized (Hesse and Gross, 2014).\nThe GIM with an external ﬁeld combined with the novel ISC technique could provide an alternative way to measure the level of awareness of patients with diﬀerent neuropathological conditions or even in non-responsive patients. In order to assess the awareness of these patients, ISC (which is a measure used in this study to calculate the conscious experience) should be calculated. To attain this goal, the audio clip from the same movie should be played for patients and fMRI data should be acquired. Then GLM should be applied on the fMRI time series by using as predictors the features of the movie (explained in Section 2.10) to obtain the coupling strengths (interaction of the external ﬁeld with the spins). Afterwards, using disrupted structural connectivities (Jij) of these patients and the extracted coupling strengths, GIM should be simulated to obtain the simulated time series at the temperature T∗ which was previously obtained from the healthy subjects’ simulations. The ISC map (set of ISC values of each ROI) of each patient can then be obtained by calculating the correlation values between the subject’s time series with all the 17 healthy subjects’ time series and averaging them. These ISC values will give us an idea of how much the patient’s time series is correlated with the healthy subjects time series.\n\nS. Kandeepan, J. Rudas and F. Gomez et al.\n\nNeuroImage 223 (2020) 117367\n\nFig. 4. Distance (calculated using the KS-test) between the empirical and simulated ISC under stimulation, at four diﬀerent levels of consciousness. The red line represents the temperature that minimized distance between empirical and simulated ISC. Magenta, green dashed, and blue dashed lines represent the critical, sub, and super, critical temperatures, respectively, under stimulation. The orange line (Tmin) represents the temperature that minimizes the distance between the empirical and simulated correlation matrices.\n\nThen the statistical signiﬁcance of the ISC values of the patients can be tested vs the null distribution created from the ISC of healthy subjects. The main advantage of using the GIM is that it can be simulated using the structural connectivity and coupling strengths of these patients which hypothetically can be altered, until a similar ISC, or conscious experience, to the healthy controls is obtained, simulating a possible healing process. The simulations on these patients will depend mainly on the interaction of the patients with the external stimulus while a minor contribution arises from the structural connectivity as well. Coupling strengths can be assumed to be related with the metabolic activity. Astrocytes, are cells in the neuronal system which provide structural and functional support to the neurons and also assist in controlling the metabolic activity, by regulating the blood ﬂow to regions of the brain. Inﬂammation in these astrocytes tend to inhibit the blood ﬂow, resulting in reduction of metabolic activity. Treating these inﬂamed astrocytes, might help to re-gain the metabolic activity which in our model will correspond to increase the coupling strengths. Speciﬁcally for disorders of consciousness patients, according to our model, it will be more relevant to restore the metabolic activity than the ﬁbers, which in turn will restore the interaction of the external stimulation with the brain regions.\n\n5. Limitations of the study\nThe main limitation of the study is that we used the fMRI data itself to extract the beta maps. These beta maps were then used to simulate the Ising model to ﬁt the empirical data. Beta maps tell us how the proﬁle of an audio clip will couple to speciﬁc regions and which should be universally independent of the audio clip. In the future, using the beta maps extracted from one audio stimulation (audio clip of a movie) to predict the ISC for diﬀerent audio stimulations would provide better predictive power.\nAnother limitation of the study is that the model is unable to provide a proper ISC when the external ﬁeld is only coupled to the primary auditory regions. In the stimulated scenario, more than the structural connectivity, it is the coupling between the stimulus and the brain regions which is more dominant in the model. A very successful model should be able to provide proper ISC, by just coupling the external magnetic ﬁeld to the primary auditory regions, instead of the full brain. Future research should test the possibility of coupling the external ﬁeld to primary auditory regions only, while giving diﬀerent weights to Jij. This would modulate the eﬀective structure for the ﬁber connectome, taking in to account that the regions of diﬀerent networks interact diﬀerently.\n\nS. Kandeepan, J. Rudas and F.

Conclusion\nThe GIM was able to model brain activity under naturalistic stimulation, at diﬀerent levels of consciousness, using a novel ISC technique. At the temperature T∗, which is in a very super critical state, a similar pattern between the empirical and simulated ISC was observed during stimulation. ISC was not observed in the resting condition at any levels of consciousness, due to the lack of the driving force provided by the external auditory stimulation for synchronization. Distinguishing neural signatures of altered consciousness using the simple GIM may aid in the\n\ndiagnosis of patients with disorders of consciousness and can provide an indication of how their metabolic activity should be altered in order to regain consciousness.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare no competing ﬁnancial interests.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was funded by the NSERC Discovery grant (05578– 2014RGPIN), CERC (215063), CIHR Foundation Fund (167264) and Mitacs Elevate postdoctoral fellowship.\n\nS.
