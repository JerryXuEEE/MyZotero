Localization of Brain Electrical Activity via Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance Spatial Filtering
Barry D. Van Veen,* Member, IEEE, Wim van Drongelen, Moshe Yuchtman, and Akifumi Suzuki

Abstract— A spatial ﬁltering method for localizing sources of brain electrical activity from surface recordings is described and analyzed. The spatial ﬁlters are implemented as a weighted sum of the data recorded at different sites. The weights are chosen to minimize the ﬁlter output power subject to a linear constraint. The linear constraint forces the ﬁlter to pass brain electrical activity from a speciﬁed location, while the power minimization attenuates activity originating at other locations. The estimated output power as a function of location is normalized by the estimated noise power as a function of location to obtain a neural activity index map. Locations of source activity correspond to maxima in the neural activity index map. The method does not require any prior assumptions about the number of active sources of their geometry because it exploits the spatial covariance of the source electrical activity. This paper presents a development and analysis of the method and explores its sensitivity to deviations between actual and assumed data models. The effect on the algorithm of covariance matrix estimation, correlation between sources, and choice of reference is discussed. Simulated and measured data is used to illustrate the efﬁcacy of the approach.

I. INTRODUCTION
IN current clinical practice, neural activity in the brain is often recorded from scalp electrodes. The ongoing electroencephalogram and the potentials evoked by stimulation reﬂect activity from groups of neurons located in the head. Finding the sources responsible for generating this activity is a central issue in neurophysiology. Knowledge of the anatomical correlate of recorded activity is essential for diagnosis and treatment. Currently, more detailed anatomical information about abnormally active areas is obtained by implanting depth electrodes in several locations. Clinically and experimentally, one would like to avoid recording inside neural tissue, because the technique is invasive, delicate, and time consuming. Moreover, one cannot have depth electrodes at all potentially active sites, so one can overlook areas of interest.
These reasons have motivated many studies that attempt to formalize a relationship between electromagnetic activity

in the head and external recordings of the generated ﬁeld [1]–[15]. These models represent underlying neural activity by either a charge or current dipole. Starting from a known activity pattern in the brain, one can calculate the electromagnetic ﬁeld generated outside the brain in a unique fashion. This so-called forward solution depends on a number of parameters related to the geometry of the anatomical model and the electromagnetic properties of the different tissues. Some studies use a spherical model describing the head [1], [2], [5]–[8], while others reﬁne the geometric representation by using ﬁnite element or boundary element methods [3], [4], [9], [13]. The experimental and clinical problem, however, is the inverse problem: the ﬁeld is sampled at different sensor locations and the underlying activity pattern must be determined. A given set of measurements cannot generate a unique solution for the activities inside the head. To obtain a single inverse solution for a given recording, additional constraints are introduced. A problem common to all methods is determining the number of active areas that contribute to the signal studied. Some authors assume a single generator at every time instant (see e.g., [1]); others use a linear decomposition of a recorded interval as a tool to estimate the number of active sites (see e.g., [8]).
In this paper, we develop a localization method based on the principles of spatial ﬁltering. Spatial ﬁlters are designed that pass brain electrical activity from a speciﬁed location while attenuating activity originating at other locations. The power at the output of a spatial ﬁlter is an estimate of the neural power originating within the spatial passband of the ﬁlter. A map of neural power as a function of location is obtained by designing multiple spatial ﬁlters, each with a different passband, and depicting output power as a function of passband location. This spatial ﬁltering approach represents an adaptation of the multiple window minimum variance spectrum estimation method proposed by Liu and Van Veen [16] and falls within the general category of linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) ﬁltering. Spatial ﬁltering or “beamforming” using LCMV methods has been widely applied in radar and sonar [17]. Early work on LCMV beamforming includes [18] and [19].
The map of neural power would appear to provide a useful metric for source localization by associating sources with regions of large neural power. However, we show that noise introduces a spatially non uniform component to the neural power map that depends on the measurement sites. Hence, noise may cause false detection of sources or missed detection of actual sources in the neural power map. This problem is

mitigated by normalizing the neural power map by an estimate of the noise power map to obtain a neural activity index. Localization is accomplished by identifying local maxima in the neural activity index as sources.
The present approach does not require any prior assumptions about the number or spatial distribution of active sources. Indeed, under the appropriate conditions both the number and locations of sources can be determined. Distributed sources such as dipole sheets can also be identiﬁed given adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Prior source information is not required because the localization is performed using the spatial covariance matrix of the surface data. Guidelines for estimating the spatial covariance matrix from measured data are discussed.
Theoretical considerations in applying the LCMV method to neurophysiology were previously reported in [11] and [20]. Related ideas have also been reported in the literature. An application of spatial ﬁltering to monitoring speciﬁc regions of the brain has been discussed by Spencer et al. [21]. Dale and Sereno [12] require estimates of dipole variance needed in their constrained linear approach to solving the inverse problem. The method used to estimate the dipole variance is based on the MUSIC algorithm [10] and is similar in certain aspects to the approach taken here. Description of the similarities and differences is provided in the discussion section. van Drongelen et al. [22] use the LCMV localization technique with simulated and measured electrophysiological data in order to explore the method’s resolving power and ability to detect multiple sources. In the present paper, we provide a detailed exposition of the LCMV method and study the sensitivity of the approach to deviation between the actual and assumed data models.

The electrical activity of an individual neuron is assumed

to be a random process inﬂuenced by external inputs to the

neuron. Hence, we model the dipole moment as a random

quantity and describe its behavior in terms of mean and

covariance. Speciﬁcally, we denote the moment mean vector

II. DATA MODEL

The LCMV approach is based on source and head models

that relate the underlying neural activity to the distribution of

potential (electric, magnetic, or both) measured at the surface.

This section develops these models and relates them to the

ﬁrst- and second-order statistics of the data. For notation,

lower- and upper-case boldface symbols represent vector and

matrix quantities, respectively. Superscript denotes matrix

transpose and superscript matrix inverse. The trace of the

matrix is written as tr .

The current dipole is a key component of our model relating

the surface measurements to the underlying neural activity. An

individual active neuron is reasonably modeled as a current

dipole. Active areas in the cortex can be modeled by an

equivalent electrical dipole. The relationship between dipole

models and the surface recordings is obtained as follows.

Let be an

vector composed of the potentials

measured at the electrode sites at a given instant in

time associated with a single dipole source. If this source

We estimate this variance by determining how much of the covariance matrix is consistent with the transfer matrix for a given location.
Electrical data is collected as a potential measured with respect to a reference electrode. Our experience indicates that the LCMV method is generally insensitive to the choice of reference electrode. This observation is based on obtaining virtually identical results when using the same data set but recomputing the potentials with respect to differing electrodes (see, e.g., Section V-B). However, it is straightforward to preprocess the data to guarantee that all results are independent of the reference electrode.
The effect of the reference is to add a constant, unknown potential to each electrode. This is expressed mathematically as follows. If and are potentials measured at the same set of electrodes with respect to different reference electrodes, then

on the basis of their spatial location. This concept completely parallels the more familiar temporal ﬁltering, where one discriminates between signals based on their temporal frequency content. Hence, a “narrowband” spatial ﬁlter passes signals originating from a small “passband” volume while attenuating those originating from other locations. Temporal ﬁltering involves operating on time samples of a signal; spatial ﬁltering involves processing spatial samples of a signal. In the present application, the spatial samples are elements of the data vector and the spatial ﬁlter is implemented as a weighted combination of these samples. The goal is to design a bank of spatial ﬁlters where each ﬁlter passes signals originating from a speciﬁed location within the brain while attenuating signals from other locations. A display of the variance or power at the output of each ﬁlter as a function of the ﬁlter’s spatial “passband” location provides an estimate of the distribution of activity within the brain.

Given the limitations on the stopband attenuation, one

naturally asks how to design a ﬁlter that is optimal in some

sense. The LCMV approach offers a guiding philosophy for

designing an optimal ﬁlter. The idea is to ﬁnd a

that

minimizes the variance at the ﬁlter output while satisfying

the linear response constraint (13). Hence, the name linearly

constrained minimum variance. The constraints insure that the

signals of interest are passed by the ﬁlter. Minimization of

variance optimally allocates the stop band response of the

ﬁlter to minimize the contribution to the ﬁlter output due to

signals in the stop band. This strategy only forces the stopband

response to be small at a location if there is signiﬁcant

energy originating from .

B. LCMV Localization
Using (23) in (11) gives an estimate of the moment at location . The estimated variance or strength of the activity at is the value of the cost function in (15) and (16) at the minimum. After some algebra we obtain

Var

tr

(24)

To perform localization, we estimate the variance or strength as a function of location within the volume of the brain. This is accomplished by evaluating (24) as a function of . Regions of large variance presumably have substantial neural activity, while regions with small variance can be considered inactive. We refer to (24) as the estimated “spatial spectrum” of the neural activity. It corresponds to the multiple window minimum variance spectrum estimator described in [16].
This approach does not assume that all sources of activity in the brain are represented by equivalent dipoles, but rather that any source can be explained as a weighted combination of dipoles. Hence, the geometry of sources is not restricted to points, but may be distributed in nature. The source distribution is directly represented by the distribution of signiﬁcant variance values. Furthermore, this approach does not require speciﬁcation or determination of the number of dipole sources to ﬁt to the data. Note that anatomical information is easily included by only evaluating (24) at locations corresponding to physically realistic source locations.
The resolution of detail in the spatial spectrum is ultimately limited by the minimum “width” or spatial extent of the ﬁlter’s passband. Two distinct sources that are located within the passband of a particular ﬁlter cannot be resolved. The spatial extent of the passband depends on the transfer matrices
, which in turn depend on the number of electrodes, their distribution, and source location. Simulations indicate that superﬁcial activity can be resolved with much greater detail than deep activity. The resolution also depends on the SNR associated with the feature of interest. This is a consequence of the variance minimization procedure used to determine the spatial ﬁlters. As SNR increases, resolution increases. Note that since our analysis is covariance based, SNR is deﬁned as the variance of the source divided by the variance of the noise. This is in contrast to the more usual notion of SNR employed in electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked potential (EP) analysis, the ratio of the source amplitude to the noise standard deviation.

C. The Neural Activity Index and Noise

The SNR of measured data is often small, so the noise com-

prises a signiﬁcant component of the estimated neural activity

obtained using (24). Noise that appears spatially concentrated

or non uniformly distributed in the spatial spectrum will

interfere with localization of actual neural sources. Consider

the estimated spatial spectrum assuming

to uncorrelated noise,

. In this case, (24) simpliﬁes to

Var

tr

(25)

Hence, the noise spatial spectrum depends on the transfer

matrices

. Note that for locations far from any

electrode, the elements of

are generally quite small,

so

will have large elements, resulting in

a large value for Var . In contrast, for locations close

to an electrode,

will have several large elements and

will have generally have small elements,

resulting in a small value for Var . Because deep source

locations are relatively far from electrodes, noise generally has

a dome shaped spatial spectrum with the peak of the dome

centered at the deepest locations. This dome may be warped

signiﬁcantly if the electrodes are distributed nonuniformly, or

if the geometry of the head is assumed to be very nonuniform.

The LCMV spatial spectrum is not linear, that is, the spatial

spectrum due to a sum of signals is not the sum of the

individual spatial spectra. This is a consequence of the inverses in (24). However, application of the matrix inversion lemma1

to (6) and substitution into (24) indicates that (24) always

contains an additive noise component of the form

D. Correlated Sources Recall that the moments associated with distinct dipoles
were assumed to be uncorrelated [see (4)]. The presence of correlation between distinct sources can lead to reduction of the estimated variance for the sources that are correlated.
Letting (28)
be the cross covariance between sources at and , the output variance at location is given as tr
tr

tr

(26)

This corresponds to the noise spatial spectrum in the absence of other signals. Due to the relatively low SNR’s associated with typical data, the noise spatial spectrum may obscure the spatial spectrum of the neural activity of interest. This problem is reduced by normalizing the estimated spatial spectrum of the data by the estimated noise spatial spectrum to obtain the normalized estimate

tr

Var

(27)

tr

We term this estimate the neural activity index.

The numerator of (27) is an estimate of the source plus

noise variance at and the denominator is an estimate of

the noise variance at ; hence, the neural activity index may

be interpreted as an estimate of the source to noise variance

as a function of location. The normalization is a function of

location so the relative levels of estimated neural activity at

different locations is changed. In principle, the absolute level

can still be determined by reversing the normalization after

speciﬁc features are identiﬁed.

The neural activity index requires knowledge the noise

known to be source free, such as pre stimulus data in a EP’s

experiment. Alternatively, if the noise is assumed uncorrelated

between channels, then

. Note that the absolute level of

the noise is not required, it is only the shape or form of the

noise covariance that is needed. Changing the absolute level

modiﬁes the entire estimate by a common constant.

that would make the cross terms in the second through

of the source at tr

less than its true value, tr

. The spatial ﬁlter exploits

the correlation between sources to minimize output variance

by canceling the correlated portion of the source of interest.

Correlated source cancellation is a phenomenon that is well

known in adaptive beamforming applications of the LCMV

method for radar and sonar [23].

Perfect correlation between spatially distinct sources in the

brain is unlikely, although partial correlation is expected in

certain situations, such as when several brain areas react to

an external stimulus or become activated by a common third

active area. We explore the performance of the LCMV method

in the presence of correlated source activity in the simulation

section. The results indicate that the method is robust to

moderate levels of correlation between sources.

In practice,

is unknown and must be estimated from the

available data. One estimate is the sample covariance matrix

(30)

where

(31)

is the sample mean and

are observations

of the phenomena to be localized. Note that these observations

must all correspond to the same underlying spatial spectrum,

that is, the data must be wide sense stationary. If the data set

contains observations associated with different spatial spectra,

the estimated spatial spectrum derived using the covariance

estimate (30) will correspond to a mixture of the underlying

spatial spectra.

The number of observations must at minimum exceed

the number of elements in each data vector, , for

to

be nonsingular. Since

is constructed from random data,

it is a random quantity. Randomness in

will introduce

randomness into the estimated spatial spectrum. Excessive

randomness may obscure features of interest or result in false

recognition of nonexistent sources. This randomness decreases

as increases. Statistical analyzes assuming independent

Gaussian distributed observations for related problems [16],

[24] have shown that for a given true covariance matrix the

ratio of to determines the randomness in the estimated

spatial spectrum. A common rule of thumb in such problems is

to choose several times as large as . Hence, if

electrodes are used, then on the order of 300–400 independent

observations should be used to construct

This guideline may be difﬁcult to satisfy in some appli-

cations. For example, in some patients it may be difﬁcult to

identify several hundred epileptic spikes. An alternative is to

use multiple observations or samples in time from each single

event, such as a spike, to construct

. In this approach

the variability used for localization is due in part to the time

variation of the event. If multiple samples in time are used

to construct the covariance matrix, then one must assume that

the data is wide sense stationary over the time interval, that

is, that all data is associated with the same underlying spatial

spectrum. A second concern with using multiple time samples

is possible reductions in the degree of statistical independence

between adjacent observations. Any statistical dependence will

increase the number of observations needed to maintain com-

parable levels of randomness in the covariance matrix estimate.

If multiple observations of an event are available and the

data is temporally stationary, then one can ask whether the best

performance is obtained using time samples of an averaged

event or using time samples of all observations to estimate

the covariance matrix. The answer to this question is complex

and in general requires complete statistical characterization of

neural activity. A signiﬁcant factor is the relative variability

of the noise to that of signal or sources over both time and

from observation to observation. Averaging procedures reduce

both the variance associated with sources and the variance

associated with the noise. If the decrease in noise variance obtained by averaging is greater than the decrease in signal variance, then averaging is advantageous. For example, if the signal variability is primarily over time and not from one observation to another, then at low SNR averaging improves performance since it reduces the noise variability but does not decrease the temporal variability of the signal. A lesssigniﬁcant factor is the reduced the number of data vectors available for estimating the covariance matrix when averaging is used. With fewer data vectors the randomness in the covariance matrix estimate would tend to increase. However, averaging also changes the underlying true data covariance matrix by reducing the noise component, an effect that tends to reduce the randomness in the estimated covariance matrix.
Our simulations demonstrate that the LCMV approach is effective when the primary variability is over time or from one observation to another (see Section V-D). The method for determining the estimated covariance matrix may be changed to exploit the underlying mechanism for signal and noise variability.

V. EXAMPLES

Intuitively, one might assume that the quality of the results

obtained with the spatial ﬁltering approach is determined by

a number of factors including the SNR of the measurements,

the number and distribution of sensors, and in general the

match between the assumptions in the model and reality. In

this section, we explore the results obtained by the spatial

ﬁltering method when some of the parameters are varied

and certain assumptions are partially violated. To exclude the

effects of model geometry and allow for quantitative control

of certain variables, we study the effects in a number of

simulations where the measurements and the transfer function

are generated with the same model. Other parameters such as

signal-to-noise, electrode positions, and number of electrodes

are kept close to realistic values. The performance under

realistic conditions is evaluated using data collected from a

patient with implanted depth electrodes.

The physical model for the head is a three-shell sphere. The

outer shell models the skin, the middle shell represents the

skull surrounding the centrally located brain tissue. The surface

potential of the outer layer was calculated with the algorithm

described in [6]. With the exception of the simulations with

variable reference electrode, all simulations assume a reference

at an inﬁnite distance with zero potential. The electrode

locations are determined by mapping standard 10–20 system

plus extended positions [25] onto a spherical head. The outer

radius of the assumed head is 8.25 cm; the middle and

outer shells are 0.3-cm and 0.7-cm thick, respectively. The

conductivity ratio between bone and soft tissue is 0.0125.

The transfer matrices

are calculated for horizontally

located cross sections at 1-cm intervals. In each of the sections,

transfer functions are determined on a uniform grid with

0.25-cm spacing in each direction. The neural activity index

landscape and contour plots represent horizontal cross sections

of the head. The vertical location of each cross section is

represented by a position on a -axis, with increasing height

corresponding to increasing values. Within each cross section the -axis is front–back with front positive and the
-axis is right–left with left positive.

A. Neural Activity Index and Electrode Distribution

In many laboratories, the distribution of the recording

electrodes is adapted to the assumed localization of the neural

dysfunction. As described in Section III-C, the noise dis-

tribution is related to electrode positions. For this reason,

we evaluate performance of the algorithm with different 32-

channel electrode montages: one with a homogeneous elec-

trode distribution and the other with all electrodes on one half

(a)

of the sphere. In the homogeneous distribution the selection

is: Fp1, Fp2, AF3, AF4, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, FC5, FC1, FC2,

FC6, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, CP5, CP1, CP2, CP6, T5, P3, Pz,

P4, T6, PO3, PO4, O1, Oz, O2; the other distribution contains

only frontally located positions: Fp1, Fpz, Fp2, AF7, AF3,

AFz, AF4, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7,

FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T9, T3, C5, C3,

C1, Cz.

The noise spatial spectrum computed using (24) in the

horizontal section at the center of the sphere (

cm) is

shown in Fig. 1. The covariance matrix represents white noise

. The result for the symmetrical electrode positions

[Fig. 1(a)] shows a dome shaped noise distribution, while the

frontally located electrode distribution generates more noise

(b)

in the occipital area [Fig. 1(b)]. In cases with a low SNR this

montage dependent noise distribution presents a problem since

it may obscure actual sources. For this reason, we normalize

the spatial spectrum by the noise spatial spectrum to obtain

the neural activity index (27). The neural activity indexes for

both montages are identical, and depicted in Fig. 1(c).

B. Dependence on Reference Choice

Choice of reference electrode is always an issue in clinical

neurophysiology. One is most likely to detect activity standing

out against the background when the signals are recorded with

a reference that is remote. If the reference is close to the

activity, the signal will appear in all recorded channels and

prevent easy localization based on visual inspection.

We simulated several cases in which we evaluated spatial

ﬁlter output having a pair of sources separated by 3 cm at a

depth of 0.75 cm from the surface of the inner sphere and

located in a horizontal section at

cm. The SNR (vari-

ance) was set at 9.5. We evaluated three different situations: 1)

reference at inﬁnity; 2) reference being the closest positioned

electrode; 3) using the most remotely located electrode as the

reference. The homogeneous 32-channel montage described

in the previous subsection was employed. The neural activity

index varied only slightly; the sources were detected in the

correct locations in all three cases. In the different situations,

the maximum values of the neural activity index varied by

only 10%. The largest difference was found between the close

reference and the two other situations; with the close reference

resulting in a higher peak value. The landscapes of the neural

activity index plotted on a relative scale were very similar in

C. Correlated Sources
We previously noted that correlation between sources may lead to degraded algorithm performance. For this reason, we examined the effect of uncorrelated, partially correlated and completely correlated source activity in two different

simulations, one with two sources having a small interdistance

and another with two sources having a large interdistance. The

sources are located in the inner sphere at

cm: the close

sources have

coordinates of 1.375, 6.375, and 1.625,

6.375; the distant sources have

coordinates of 1.375,

6.375, and 1.375, 6.375. The correlation between the sources

was varied by assuming the dipole moments and were

related by

Here, determines the degree of correlation between the

sources and represents the uncorrelated component. We

considered cases in which the sources are uncorrelated (

), partially correlated (

), and completely correlated

(

). The uncorrelated component was adjusted in each

case to obtain a SNR of ten.

The result of these simulations is shown in Fig. 2. The ﬁrst

column of landscape plots [Fig. 2(a)–(c)] shows the effects of

correlation for the closely spaced dipoles. In the uncorrelated

case the two peaks can be distinguished clearly [Fig. 2(a)].

With moderate correlation increases the peaks start to merge

[Fig. 2(b)] and in the fully correlated case [Fig. 2(c)] only

one peak located in the middle is evident. For remote sources

the result is somewhat different. The noncorrelated situation

generates two distinct peaks in the landscape of the neural

activity index [Fig. 2(d)]. As illustrated in Fig. 2(e), partial

correlation decreases the height of each peak, but still allows

detection of the dipole locations. Fully correlated distant

sources have a tendency to cancel each other in the neural

activity index [see Fig. 2(f), note that the scale has changed].

D. Covariance Matrix Estimation—Mean and Variance

A major difference between this method and most currently

available techniques is the use of (co)variance instead of signal

amplitude. As described previously, the covariance matrix can

be estimated in different ways. One can use observations from

a recording at time instants that one believes are comparable;

e.g., peaks in different spikes or EP responses. Alternatively,

if one has reason to believe that a certain area is active over

a given time interval, one can select a sequence of sampled

points. Both approaches can also be combined by selecting

a window of measured values over comparable epochs in

a signal. In each case, we assume the observations used to

estimate the covariance matrix represent brain activity at the

same locations.

We used simulations to examine the efﬁcacy of different

approaches for selecting the observations used to estimate

the covariance matrix. A single dipole at

cm,

cm, and

cm was used to generate data for

the homogeneous 32-channel montage described previously.

The source consisted of a dipole moment whose time variation

is represented by 75 samples taken from one cycle of a

sinusoid plus a random component. Noise was added to obtain

a SNR of approximately ten. Two different situations are

considered: one in which the sinusoidal amplitude variation

contributes 20% of the total source power and a second in

which the sinusoidal amplitude variation represents 80% of

the total source power. The random component of the source

generates the remaining power. In each of the situations we generated 75 repetitions. Three different techniques were used to estimate the covariance matrix from the 75 repetitions of the 75 time points: 1) using all 75 time points of all 75 repetitions; 2) using a single time point (the ﬁfth) in the 75 repetitions; and 3) using all 75 time points after averaging the 75 repetitions.
The results of the simulation are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a)–(c) represents the results for the dipole with a relatively high amplitude, and Fig. 3(d)–(f), the dipole with a high variance component. The ﬁrst row of Fig. 3 [(a), (d)] depicts the results when all time points of all repetitions are used to estimate the covariance matrix. In this case, there is no difference between the high amplitude and high variance cases. Use of a single observation gives best results when the signal has a high variance component as illustrated in Fig. 3(e). Estimating the covariance matrix from the average of the repetitions works best with the large amplitude component case, although excellent results are also obtained in the high variance case [Fig. 3(c) and (f)].
E. Localization of Stimulus Electrode Positions in the Brain
The simulations presented thus far use the same model geometry to generate the data and the transfer matrices. This facilitates examination of effects that cannot be controlled or measured in a realistic situation. However, in a realistic situation the modeled geometry is only an approximation to the actual geometry. We now explore the sensitivity of the method to deviations between actual and assumed geometry by using actual neurophysiological data. This implies we must relate the locations of sources identiﬁed in our spherical model to their actual location in the human head. In most neurophysiological recordings, the real source location(s) is/are unknown. Recorded data can be used to verify localization algorithms only in unusual cases. The best example of such exceptional data is where the source is artiﬁcially planted in the brain.
We obtained this type of data from a patient that had a possibility of epilepsy after craniotomy for clipping an intracranial aneurysm. Electrodes were inserted during craniotomy and used to monitor EEG after surgery. Stimulation was performed with informed consent of the patient. A stimulus pulse was delivered between different sets of electrodes to induce neural activity. One series of pulses were delivered between the two most “proximal” electrodes (set 1); the other between the most “distal” pair (set 2). The X rays from a lateral and fronto-dorsal view are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). The position of set 1 is medial, slightly occipital and approximately 1 cm lower than set 2. The EEG and stimulus pulse were measured using only 20 channels (the 10–20 positions plus Oz) with linked ears as a reference; the data was ampliﬁed by 20 000 and ﬁltered to pass components between 1 and 90 Hz. As can be seen in the example of set 1 data depicted in Fig. 4(c), the amplitude of the generated signal is slightly higher than the surrounding EEG; a situation comparable to an epileptic spike. To remove signals from other EEG sources, the data was highpass ﬁltered at 40 Hz; the result shown in Fig. 4(d). Nineteen samples from seven pulses were used to estimate the covariance matrix.
The contour plots of the neural activity index for sets 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 4(e) and (f). The peaks associated with

The dipole moment of the source has a repeatable sinusoidal component plus a random component. In (a)–(c), 80% of the activity is the repeatable component and 20% random. In (d)–(f), the repeatable component is 20% with 80% random. The data consist of 75 time points from 75 trials. In (a) and (d) the covariance matrix is estimated using the entire data record, in (b) and (d) a single time point in each trial is used, while in (c) and (e) the 75 time points in the average over the trials is used. The scale of the neural activity index is adjusted in each case. There is no difference between the primarily repeatable and the primarily random case [(a), (d)] when the entire data set is employed. Selecting a single point in each trial works best if the source is primarily random (e). Averaging reduces the trial to trial variability in the source as well as the noise and gives the best result when the source is dominated by a repeatable component (c), although excellent results are obtained in the random component case (f), since averaging does not reduce the source randomness within the trial.

Measurements necessary to register the source locations indicated on the X

ray with the coordinates of our spherical head model were not available, so we compare the relative positions of the actual and estimated sources to the 10–20 system electrode locations. The correspondence is very good. Viewed laterally on a Front-Back axis, the sources are located between the

In the frontal plane on a right–left axis, both sources are on the right side; set 2 close to the line that connects Fp2 and O2. The relative positions of the set 1 and set 2 sources are also as expected: the set 1 source is found deeper, more medial and occipital than the set 2 source.
VI. DISCUSSION
The LCMV spatial ﬁltering method described herein is attractive because one does not have to determine the number

of active sources a priori. The requirement of knowing the number of active sources a priori, or estimating the number from the data is a major limitation in most proposed source localization algorithms, for example [1], [5], [7], [8], [10], [26], and [27]. When the number of estimated sources is less than the true number of active areas such algorithms will typically detect resultant activity somewhere in between the actual areas. A trivial example of such a mislocalization is single dipole localization performed on bilateral somatosensory stimulation. Both hemispheres are active from approximately 20 ms after bilateral stimulation of the wrist. However, it is well known that single dipole analyzes performed on the so

The solution is based on a spherical model. The maximum activity in set 1 is found 1 cm below the center of the sphere while the set 2 maximum is located 1 cm higher. The relative positions of the maxima and the position of each maxima relative to the surface electrode positions agree well with the anatomical positions of the stimulus electrodes.

called N20 yield a resultant source whose anatomical correlate

is the medial ﬁssure between the hemispheres. In this example,

the error is easy to correct by assuming two active areas. In

many other situations such an easy correction is not feasible

because an educated guess of the number of active areas cannot

be made. The examples in Section V and [22] illustrate that

distinct peaks in the neural activity index can actually indicate

the number of sources under certain conditions.

The localization technique presented here is closely related

to the adaptive ﬁltering approach of Spencer et al. [21]. They

describe a method for monitoring the time series associated

with a component of a current dipole source vector at a given

location. An LCMV criterion is used to determine the adaptive

ﬁlter coefﬁcients, resulting in an expression equivalent to (23).

Synthetic data is used to illustrate the potential effectiveness

of the approach.

Our work is also related to that of Dale and Sereno [12].

First of all, they also employ covariance information for

localization, assuming sources are zero mean. Second, they

estimate the dipole strength as a function of location using a

linear function of the sensor data. However, instead of using

an LCMV criterion to ﬁnd the linear operator, they minimize

the expected error between the estimated and actual solution.

The linear operator is then dependent on the dipole and noise

covariance matrices which are unknown. They propose either

assuming a form for these covariance matrices a priori, or

attempt to estimate them from the sensor covariance. The

dipole variance is estimated using a modiﬁcation of the multi-

ple signal classiﬁcation (MUSIC) algorithm [10] in which the

projection of gain vectors onto each eigenvector is weighted

by the reciprocal of the corresponding eigenvalue. The gain

vector is determined from the transfer matrix

and a

priori knowledge of the dipole orientation. The functional form

of the neural activity index (27) is similar to their modiﬁcation

of the MUSIC algorithm in the special case

. We do not

presuppose knowledge of the dipole orientation and thus the

neural activity index depends on all columns of

rather

than a gain vector.

The LCMV approach is easily modiﬁed to incorporate prior

knowledge of dipole orientation. Let

be the gain vector

associated with a dipole at location . We now design a single

spatial ﬁlter

to minimize output variance subject to a

unit gain constraint on the response to the dipole of interest,

resulting in the LCMV problem

. Note that our

derivation of the neural activity index using principles of spa-

tial ﬁltering offers insight into performance and characteristics

that are not evident from the MUSIC-based variance estimator

derivation. This variance estimator contains contributions due

to the dipole source at , other dipoles that leak through

the spatial ﬁlter sidelobes, and noise. The effect of these

two contaminants on the linear operator used to perform

localization in [12] and the ultimate localization performance

has not been reported.

As in any approach, the LCMV spatial ﬁltering method de-

scribed here is developed assuming a model for the underlying

neural activity. Our results suggest that the algorithm is robust

to many violations of the underlying assumptions.

The effect of correlation between sources is evaluated

using analysis and simulations. The simulation results (Fig. 2)

indicate that localization of correlated sources is possible

as long as some of the source activity is uncorrelated. If

there is a high correlation between sources, one may obtain

resultant activity in between the real active areas [Fig. 2(c)],

similar to the resultant activity in other localization algorithms

associated with under estimation of the number of sources. In our case, the algorithm effectively treats closely spaced correlated sources as a single source. Alternatively, the activity level is generally underestimated if the correlated sources are relatively distant [Fig. 2(f)]. Although some correlation in neural activity in the brain is expected, perfect correlation between spatially disparate is unlikely. Hence, we believe that the partially correlated cases in Fig. 2(b) and (e) are realistic. While partial correlation decreases the estimated activity level, power of the ﬁlter output, different sources still may be distinguished given a reasonable SNR and enough electrodes.
The LCMV approach is an attempt to exploit variable features in the data. Neural responses, as all physiological processes, are not perfectly reproducible. The variability in subaverages of an EP and in spike and seizure activity in an electroencephalogram are likely due to both variability in the underlying signal as well as surrounding ongoing activity. The method is robust to the source of variability used for localization, whether epoch to epoch variations or variation over time. This allows considerable ﬂexibility in obtaining data with which to estimate the covariance matrix. For example, in situations with low SNR such as an evoked response, averaging can be used to reduce noise. Averaging also reduces signal epoch to epoch variability, but will not reduce the temporal variation associated with the repeatable component of the response. This temporal variation can be used for localization by estimating the covariance matrix with temporal samples. We have illustrated the effect of using epoch to epoch variability and temporal variability to estimate the covariance matrix in simulations by varying the relative contributions of source amplitude and variance (Fig. 3). In general, the best method for estimating the covariance matrix depends on the source’s relative components of temporal and epoch to epoch variability and the noise statistics.
We have assumed that the data used to estimate the covariance matrix results from a stationary source distribution. If different source distributions are represented in the covariance matrix, the neural activity index will represent a combined activity pattern. For example, suppose one source is active in the ﬁrst part of the data and two others are active in the second part. The neural activity index based on the combined data will in general indicate three active sources. If many active areas are present, the neural activity index will likely indicate a broad region of activity and individual sources will not be evident. The method cannot resolve differences in the underlying activity distributions once the corresponding data is combined into a single covariance matrix estimate. Determining whether a data set corresponds to a stationary spatial source distribution is beyond the scope of the present work. One may assume that similar areas of the brain are involved in different subaverages of a EP because the activity is stimulus related. During an epileptic discharge it may be necessary to compare the topography of a series of spikes before concluding that different spikes originate from the same underlying source distribution.
The data generated by implanted electrodes was chosen to have approximately the same order of magnitude as the spontaneous electrical activity [see Fig. 4(c)] in order to

approximate a typical epileptic discharge. This assumption on

the relative magnitude of an epileptic discharge is supported

by data described in van Drongelen et al. [22]. The primary

purpose of this data set is to demonstrate the methods ability

to localize when there are deviations between the actual

and assumed head geometry (see Fig. 4). The sources were

localized in a diffuse area because only 20 electrodes were

used. While increasing the number of electrodes would lead

to improved resolving capability, it would also increase the

sensitivity to deviations between actual and assumed geome-

tries. High-resolution results when the spatial ﬁlter is able to

discriminate between signals with subtle differences in their

transfer matrices due to location. Modeling errors also lead to

subtle differences in transfer matrices. When modeling errors

are present, the spatial ﬁltering constraint no longer insures

that a source at a given location is passed with unit gain

because the actual and modeled transfer matrices differ. If

the electrode array has high enough resolution to discriminate

between actual and modeled transfer matrices, then the spatial

ﬁlter will attenuate the source, resulting in underestimation

of source power. Hence, the importance of accurate head

modeling increases with increasing numbers of electrodes.

In this particular data set, the errors introduced by assuming

a spherical model should be minimal because the sources are

centrally located. Note that our spatial ﬁltering approach for

solving the inverse problem is not limited to a particular head

model for solving the forward problem. Indeed, as in most

approaches to solving the inverse problem, use of a more

realistic head model will lead to more accurate localization

results.

Finally, we demonstrated in Section V-B that the choice

of reference does not impact the accuracy of the solution

provided the

is determined with respect to the chosen

reference. In clinical EEG, the reference choice often plays

an important role in distinguishing relevant activity from

background signals. Our method may resolve some of these

issues since it appears to generate reference independent

solutions. We note that our method may also be applied to

the so-called bipolar montage that is often used to distinguish

locally generated signals from noise. This montage does not

employ a common reference, but rather each electrode is

referenced to its neighbor; in effect, a spatial derivative is

computed. The spatial ﬁltering approach can be applied to

such data by determining

in a bipolar fashion. That

is, the columns of

represents the differences between

neighboring electrodes associated with a unit dipoles oriented

in the , and coordinate directions at location .

The results presented in this paper suggest that the spatial

ﬁltering approach has considerable potential as a source lo-

calization tool. The method gives good results under realistic

conditions and is robust to deviations in the assumed signal

model. Additional experience with real data is needed to fully

validate the effectiveness of this technique.
