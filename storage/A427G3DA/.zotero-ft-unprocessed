Here we introduce a machine-learning technique—Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn)—able to uncover data-driven disease phenotypes with distinct temporal progression patterns, from widely available cross-sectional patient studies. Results from imaging studies in two neurodegenerative diseases reveal subgroups and their distinct trajectories of regional neurodegeneration. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, SuStaIn identiﬁes genotypes from imaging alone, validating its ability to identify subtypes; further the technique reveals within-genotype heterogeneity. In Alzheimer’s disease, SuStaIn uncovers three subtypes, uniquely characterising their temporal complexity. SuStaIn provides ﬁnegrained patient stratiﬁcation, which substantially enhances the ability to predict conversion between diagnostic categories over standard models that ignore subtype (p = 7.18 × 10−4) or temporal stage (p = 3.96 × 10−5). SuStaIn offers new promise for enabling disease subtype discovery and precision medicine.\n\nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed to A.L.Y.

Key contributors to this heterogeneity are that individuals belong to a range of disease subtypes (giving rise to phenotypic heterogeneity) and are at different stages of a dynamic disease process (producing temporal heterogeneity). Previous studies aiming to explain biomarker variance typically focus on a single aspect of this heterogeneity: phenotypic heterogeneity at a coarse, typically late, disease stage or temporal heterogeneity in a broad population. However, the inability to disentangle the range of subtypes from the development and progression of each over time limits the biological insight these techniques can provide, as well as their utility for patient stratiﬁcation. Constructing a comprehensive picture separating phenotypic and temporal heterogeneity, i.e. identifying distinct subtypes and characterising the development and progression of each, remains a major current challenge. However, such a picture would provide insights into underlying disease mechanisms, and enable accurate ﬁne-grained patient stratiﬁcation and prognostication, facilitating precision medicine in clinical trials and healthcare.\nBoth FTD and AD exhibit substantial pathologic, genetic and clinical heterogeneity. In FTD a large proportion of cases (around a third) are inherited on an autosomal-dominant basis, with mutations in progranulin (GRN), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) being the most common causes. Of the major genetic groups, GRN mutations are associated with TDP-43 type A pathology, MAPT mutations with tau inclusions, and expansions in C9orf72 with type A or type B TDP-43 pathology1. AD instead has a single pathological characterisation: the presence of both amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles, and the proportion of autosomal-dominant cases is much smaller, accounting for between 1 and 6% of cases2. The pathological heterogeneity observed in AD consists of variation in the distribution of neuroﬁbrillary tangles, with 25% of patients having an atypical distribution of neuroﬁbrillary tangles (described as hippocampalsparing or limbic-predominant) on autopsy at the time of death3. Both FTD and AD exhibit a diverse range of clinical syndromes. FTD has both behavioural and language presentations, and in genetic FTD the clinical syndromes can further include atypical parkinsonism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In AD, the major clinical syndrome is broadly divided into amnestic and rarer nonamnestic variants, with non-amnestic variants including language variant AD, logopenic progressive aphasia, visuoperceptive variant AD, posterior cortical atrophy and frontal variant AD4.\nPrevious studies of neurodegenerative disease heterogeneity have focussed on either temporal heterogeneity (i.e. subjects appear different at different disease stages) or phenotypic heterogeneity (i.e. distinct groups of subjects appear different even at the same disease stage), but rarely both. We refer to these two approaches as stages-only models, which account for temporal heterogeneity but not phenotypic heterogeneity, and subtypesonly models, which account for phenotypic heterogeneity but not temporal heterogeneity. Stages-only models arise for example from regression against disease stage5,6, and data-driven disease progression modelling7–15. Although such models have enabled deeper understanding of the temporal progression of a range of conditions, the inherent assumption that all individuals have a single phenotype, i.e. follow approximately the same trajectory, is a key limitation. At best, this limits the biological insight and the accuracy of stratiﬁcation they can provide, but potentially could\n\nalso lead to erroneous conclusions. Subtypes-only models use, for example, clustering (e.g. refs. 16–23) to identify distinct groups, or group individuals using information independent of the model, such as genetics (e.g. ref. 24) or post-mortem examination (e.g. refs. 25–28) for models based on in vivo imaging. With typical subtypes-only models, the limitation is the inherent assumption that all subjects are at a common disease stage so that the cohort has no temporal heterogeneity. This requires a priori staging and selection of individuals, which is typically crude in practice leaving models that are not speciﬁc to subtype differences. Models of both disease subtype and stage heterogeneity have been constructed previously for the small proportion of neurodegenerative diseases that are inherited on an autosomal-dominant basis. For example, Rohrer et al.29 investigate temporal heterogeneity within genetic groups by regressing imaging markers against an estimated age of onset (from family history). However, such studies lack the ability to identify within-genotype phenotypes, and the temporal resolution of the recovered genotype progression patterns is limited by inaccuracy of the a priori staging.\nThis paper presents Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn): a computational technique that disentangles temporal and phenotypic heterogeneity to identify population subgroups with common patterns of disease progression. We demonstrate SuStaIn using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets from cohorts of genetic FTD and AD patients. In each case, SuStaIn provides a data-driven taxonomy (set of subtypes and stages), as well as detailed pictures of the progression of neurodegeneration within each of the data-driven subgroups. From the genetic FTD data set, SuStaIn identiﬁes subtypes from imaging alone that map closely onto the genotypes and reconstructs patterns of neurodegeneration that reﬂect analysis of the individual genetic groups. This provides a validation of SuStaIn’s ability to identify subgroups with distinct temporal progression patterns, as the different genotypes are known to have distinct patterns of neurodegeneration visible as brain atrophy in MRI29. However, SuStaIn further uncovers two distinct within-genotype phenotypes for carriers of a mutation in the C9orf72 gene, while ﬁnding the MAPT and GRN mutation groups are more homogeneous. In AD, SuStaIn identiﬁes three distinct subtypes and reconstructs their previously unseen temporal progression. In both neurodegenerative diseases, we demonstrate strong assignment of individuals to the SuStaIn subtypes, which is in contrast to subtypesonly models in the literature (e.g. ref. 23). Even at very early stages, at least a proportion of individuals show strong alignment with particular subtypes, which highlights the potential utility in precision medicine. In AD, we show that SuStaIn subtype and stage enhance the ability to predict conversion between diagnostic categories substantially beyond subtypes-only or stages-only models.\nResults Subtype and stage inference. Figure 1 provides a conceptual overview of the SuStaIn modelling technique. SuStaIn is an unsupervised machine-learning technique that identiﬁes population subgroups with common patterns of disease progression. SuStaIn builds on and combines ideas from clustering (e.g. refs. 16–23) and data-driven disease progression modelling (e.g. refs. 7–10,12). The combination uniquely enables SuStaIn to group individuals with common phenotypes across the range of disease stages. It determines the number of subtypes that the available data can support, reconstructs the trajectory of stages within each subtype, and assigns a probability of each subtype and stage to each subject. These features provide insights into the underlying disease biology and a mechanism for in vivo ﬁne-grained stratiﬁcation at early disease stages.\n\n2\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2018)9:4273\n\n| DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0\n\nARTICLE\n\na\nUnderlying model\nI\n\nd\nApplication: subtyping and staging new patients\n\nProbability\n\nProbability\n\nSubtypes\n\nII\nb\n\nTime\n\nStage\n\nSubtype\n\nc\n\nI\n\nStage\n\nSubtype\n\nSubtypes\n\nSuStaIn\n\nII\n\nInput data: heterogeneous patient snapshots\n\nStages Output: reconstruction of disease subtypes and stages\n\nFig. 1 Conceptual overview of SuStaIn. The Underlying model panel (a) considers a patient cohort to consist of an unknown set of disease subtypes. The input data (Input data panel, b), which can be entirely cross-sectional, contains snapshots of biomarker measurements from each subject with unknown subtype and unknown temporal stage. SuStaIn recovers the set of disease subtypes and their temporal progression (as shown in the Output panel, c) via simultaneous clustering and disease progression modelling. Given a new snapshot, SuStaIn can estimate the probability the subject belongs to each subtype and stage, by comparing the snapshot with the reconstruction (as shown in the Application panel, d). This ﬁgure depicts two hypothetical disease subtypes, labelled I and II, and the biomarkers are regional brain volumes, but SuStaIn is readily applicable to any scalar disease biomarker and any number of subtypes. The colour of each region indicates the amount of pathology in that region, ranging from white (no pathology) to red to magenta to blue (maximum pathology)\n\nSynthetic data. A simulation study (see Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Results, Supplementary Discussion and Supplementary Figures 1–12) veriﬁes the ability of the SuStaIn algorithm to recover predeﬁned subtypes and their progression patterns from heterogeneous data sets with comparable numbers of subjects, biomarkers and clusters (subtypes) to those used in this study.\nSubtype progression patterns. We demonstrate SuStaIn in two neurodegenerative diseases, genetic FTD and sporadic AD, using cross-sectional regional brain volumes from MRI data in the GENetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). GENFI investigates biomarker changes in carriers of mutations in GRN, MAPT and C9orf72 genes, which cause FTD. GRN and MAPT mutations are known to be associated with distinct phenotypes, whereas C9orf72 is a heterogeneous group30. Here, GENFI serves as a test data set with a partially known ground truth for validation, as we expect SuStaIn to identify genetic groups as distinct phenotypic subtypes. However, it further supports investigation of the phenotypic and temporal heterogeneity within genotypes. Speciﬁcally, we ran SuStaIn on the combined data set from all 172 mutation carriers in GENFI (Fig. 2a), without genotypes, and compared the resulting subtype assignments and progression patterns with (a) participant’s genotype labels (Fig. 2b), and (b) subtype progression patterns obtained from each genotype separately (Supplementary Figure 13; 76 GRN carriers, 63 C9orf72 carriers, 33 MAPT carriers). Next, we used SuStaIn to identify sporadic AD subtypes from ADNI (793 subjects, including 524 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD) and characterise their progression from early to late disease stages (Fig. 3). We tested consistency of the SuStaIn subtypes in a largely independent data set—ADNI 1.5T MRI (576 subjects, including 396 with MCI or AD) scans (Fig. 4) rather than the main 3T data set used for Fig. 3. In each disease, cross-validation tests the reproducibility of the subtypes and estimated progression patterns (Supplementary Figure 14).\n\nSuStaIn reveals within-genotype phenotypes in FTD. Figure 2 shows that SuStaIn successfully identiﬁes the progression patterns of the different genetic groups in GENFI, without prior knowledge of genotype, and further suggests that phenotypic heterogeneity of the C9orf72 group results from two neuroanatomical subtypes. Figure 2a shows the four subtypes that SuStaIn ﬁnds from the full set of all mutation carriers in GENFI. We refer to them as the asymmetric frontal lobe subtype, temporal lobe subtype, frontotemporal lobe subtype and subcortical subtype. Figure 2b reveals that GRN mutation carriers are the main contributors to the asymmetric frontal lobe subtype, MAPT mutation carriers are the main contributors to the temporal lobe subtype, and C9orf72 mutation carriers are the main contributors to both the frontotemporal lobe subtype and the subcortical subtype. This suggests that there are two distinct subtypes in the C9orf72 group. Application of SuStaIn to each genetic group separately supports this ﬁnding by demonstrating that the GRN mutation carriers are best described as a single asymmetric frontal lobe subtype, the MAPT mutation carriers are best described as a temporal lobe subtype and the C9orf72 mutation carriers are best described as two distinct disease subtypes: a frontotemporal lobe subtype and a subcortical subtype. SuStaIn additionally ﬁnds a subsidiary cluster in the MAPT group for which the progression pattern has high uncertainty. This high uncertainty likely prevents the cluster from being detected when applying SuStaIn to all mutation carriers in Fig. 2 as this small number of subjects can be sufﬁciently modelled by the three alternative subtype progression patterns. Supplementary Figure 13 shows that the subtype progression patterns for each genetic group are in good agreement with those found in the full set of all mutation carriers (Fig. 2a). Supplementary Figure 14A shows that the four subtypes estimated in Fig. 2a are reproducible under cross-validation, with a high average similarity between cross-validation folds of >93% for each subtype. Altogether these results provide strong validation of SuStaIn’s ability to recover distinct subtypes and their progression patterns from a heterogeneous data set, while simultaneously disentangling the heterogeneity of the C9orf72 group into two distinct subtypes.\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2018)9:4273\n\n| DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\n3\n\nARTICLE\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0\n\nSuStaIn identiﬁes three subtype progression patterns in AD. Figure 3 shows the temporal progression of the three neuroanatomical subtypes that SuStaIn identiﬁes from ADNI, which we term typical, cortical and subcortical. SuStaIn reveals that for the typical subtype, atrophy starts in the hippocampus and amygdala; for the cortical subtype in the nucleus accumbens, insula and cingulate; and for the subcortical subtype in the pallidum, putamen, nucleus accumbens and caudate. Supplementary Figure 14B shows that these three subtypes are reproducible under crossvalidation, giving an average similarity between cross-validation folds of >92% for each subtype.\nAD subtypes are reproducible in an independent data set. Figure 4 shows that the three subtypes in Fig. 3 are reproducible in a largely independent data set (<5% subjects in common) consisting of regional brain volumes derived from 1.5T rather than 3T MRI scans. From the 1.5T data, SuStaIn broadly replicates the three major clusters found in the 3T data, again ﬁnding a typical, cortical and subcortical subtype. The origin of atrophy for each subtype is in general agreement with the 3T data: atrophy begins in the hippocampus and amygdala for the typical subtype, in the insula and cingulate for the cortical subtype; and in the pallidum, putamen and caudate for the subcortical subtype. The main difference compared to the 3T data is that the nucleus accumbens is not indicated as an early region to atrophy in the 1.5T data for the cortical and subcortical subtypes. SuStaIn\n\nadditionally identiﬁes a small proportion (4%) of outliers with a parietal subtype in the 1.5T data.\nDisease subtyping and staging. We investigated SuStaIn’s capability for reliable stratiﬁcation in each neurodegenerative disease (Fig. 5) to determine the potential for homogeneous cohort identiﬁcation. First, we assessed how reliably SuStaIn assigns patients to subtypes (Fig. 5a, b). Speciﬁcally, in genetic FTD, we tested the consistency of SuStaIn subtypes with the different genotypes in symptomatic mutation carriers (Table 1), and compared this consistency against models that do not account for temporal heterogeneity (Table 2). Second, we assessed the reliability of the SuStaIn stages in each disease (Fig. 5c, d) by comparison with clinical diagnostic categories. In ADNI, where clinical follow-up information is available, we further examined the ability of SuStaIn subtypes and stages to predict relevant outcomes, by determining whether SuStaIn subtype and/or stage modify the risk of conversion between diagnostic categories (Table 3).\nSuStaIn provides utility for patient stratiﬁcation. Figure 5 illustrates the ability of SuStaIn to provide disease subtyping and staging information for each neurodegenerative disease. Figure 5a shows that the strength of assignment (see Methods: Strength of assignment to subtype) to the SuStaIn subtypes in genetic FTD increases as the diseases progress, with 88% of the symptomatic\n\na\nAsymmetric frontal (CVS = 0.97, f = 0.31)\nStage 1 Stage 5 Stage 9 Stage 13 Stage 17 Stage 21 Stage 25\n\nb\n3-sigma\n\nAsym. frontal\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nTemporal (CVS = 0.98, f = 0.24)\n\nStage 1 Stage 5 Stage 9 Stage 13 Stage 17 Stage 21 Stage 25\n\n2-sigma 1-sigma Normal 3-sigma\n\nGRN MAPT C9orf72\n\nTemporal\n\n2-sigma\n\nSuStaIn subtype\n\nSuStaIn subtype\n\n1-sigma\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nFrontotemporal (CVS = 0.92, f = 0.26)\n\nStage 1 Stage 5 Stage 9 Stage 13 Stage 17 Stage 21 Stage 25\n\nNormal 3-sigma\n\nFrontotemporal\n\n2-sigma\n\n1-sigma\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nSubcortical (CVS = 0.92, f = 0.19)\n\nStage 1 Stage 5 Stage 9 Stage 13 Stage 17 Stage 21 Stage 25\n\nNormal 3-sigma\n\nSubcortical\n\n2-sigma\n\n1-sigma\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nSuStaIn stage\n\nNormal\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nGenotype contribution\n\nFig. 2 SuStaIn modelling of genetic frontotemporal dementia using GENFI data. a The progression pattern of each of four subtypes that SuStaIn identiﬁes. Each progression pattern consists of a sequence of stages in which regional brain volumes in mutation carriers (symptomatic and presymptomatic) reach different z-scores relative to non-carriers. Intuitively (for a more precise description see Methods: Uncertainty Estimation), at each stage the colour in each region indicates the level of severity of volume loss: white is unaffected; red is mildly affected (z-score of 1); magenta is moderately affected (z-score of 2); and blue is severely affected (z-score of 3 or more). The circle labelled A indicates the asymmetry of the atrophy pattern (absolute value of the difference in volume between the left and right hemispheres divided by the total volume of the left and right hemispheres) at each stage for each subtype. CVS is the model cross-validation similarity (see Methods: Similarity between two progression patterns): the average similarity of the subtype progression patterns across cross-validation folds, which ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (maximum similarity). f is the proportion of participants estimated to belong to each subtype. b The contribution of each genotype to each of the SuStaIn subtypes. This is calculated as the probability an individual has a particular genotype given that they belong to a particular subtype\n\n4\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2018)9:4273\n\n| DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0\n\nARTICLE\n\nTypical (CVS = 0.97, f = 0.35)\n\nStage 1\n\nStage 5\n\nStage 9\n\nStage 13 Stage 17 Stage 21 Stage 25\n\n3-sigma\n\n2-sigma\n\n1-sigma\n\nCortical (CVS = 0.95, f = 0.38)\n\nStage 1\n\nStage 5\n\nStage 9\n\nStage 13 Stage 17 Stage 21 Stage 25\n\nNormal 3-sigma 2-sigma\n\nSuStaIn subtype\n\n1-sigma\n\nSubcortical (CVS = 0.92, f = 0.27)\n\nStage 1\n\nStage 5\n\nStage 9\n\nStage 13 Stage 17 Stage 21 Stage 25\n\nNormal 3-sigma\n\n2-sigma\n\n1-sigma\n\nSuStaIn stage\n\nNormal\n\nFig. 3 SuStaIn modelling of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease using ADNI data. The rows show the progression pattern of the three subtypes identiﬁed by SuStaIn.

The cerebellum was not included as a region in the Alzheimer’s disease analysis and so is shaded in dark grey\n\nmutation carriers in GENFI being strongly assigned (i.e. >50% likelihood of a particular subtype). Figure 5b shows that the strength of assignment to the SuStaIn subtypes in AD also increases with disease progression, with a strong assignment of individuals to subtypes in 78% of ADNI participants with an AD diagnosis. The strong assignment of the AD subtypes that SuStaIn achieves by accounting for temporal heterogeneity is in contrast to previous studies23 that model phenotypic but not temporal heterogeneity. Moreover, the strong assignment is seen even at early disease stages (MCI), where many subjects cluster around the vertices of the triangles: 37% of MCI subjects are strongly assigned to a subtype. Figures 5c, d show that the distribution of SuStaIn stages differs between diagnostic groups in both GENFI and ADNI, and provides a good separation of presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers, and cognitively normal (CN) and AD.\nSuStaIn subtypes discriminate FTD genotype. Table 1 shows the classiﬁcation accuracy obtained using the SuStaIn subtypes in Fig. 2 to discriminate the genotype of affected mutation carriers in GENFI. While the use of MRI to identify genotype is not necessary in these subjects, so not clinically relevant, this experiment demonstrates the ability of SuStaIn to identify subtypes in a data set with a known ground truth. The SuStaIn subtypes give a balanced accuracy of 95% for the two-way classiﬁcation task of distinguishing the homogeneous GRN and MAPT carrier groups. For the more challenging three-way classiﬁcation task of distinguishing all genotypes in the presence of heterogeneity, the SuStaIn subtypes provide a maximum balanced accuracy of 86%. A high proportion of the homogeneous GRN and MAPT carrier groups are correctly assigned to the asymmetric frontal lobe (93% of affected GRN carriers) and temporal lobe subtype progression patterns (91% of affected MAPT carriers). The heterogeneous C9orf72 carrier group are much more\n\ndifﬁcult to classify, with a total of 75% of affected C9orf72 carriers being assigned to the frontotemporal lobe and subcortical subtypes. Apart from heterogeneity, the C9orf72 carriers are also more difﬁcult to classify because the frontotemporal lobe and subcortical subtype progression patterns are more similar to the other subtypes; by evaluating the similarity of each pair of subtype progression patterns (see Methods: Similarity between two subtype progression patterns) we ﬁnd that the asymmetric frontal lobe and temporal lobe subtypes have the most distinct progression patterns of any pair of subtypes; the asymmetric frontal lobe and frontotemporal lobe subtypes have the most similar progression patterns of any pair of subtypes. The precise strategy of assigning subjects to subtype can alter the classiﬁcation rates somewhat and Supplementary Table 1 examines this effect.\nGenotype discrimination out-performs subtypes-only models. Table 2 shows the classiﬁcation accuracy obtained using a subtypes-only model (Fig. 6), which does not account for temporal heterogeneity, to discriminate the genotype of affected mutation carriers in GENFI. The SuStaIn subtypes out-perform the subtypes-only model. The subtypes-only model gives a balanced accuracy of 92% compared to 95% using SuStaIn for the two-way classiﬁcation task of distinguishing GRN and MAPT carrier groups; the subtypes-only model gives a maximum balanced accuracy of 69% compared to 86% using SuStaIn for the three-way classiﬁcation task of distinguishing all genotypes. In the subtypes-only model the majority of misclassiﬁcations arise from the earlier stage affected GRN and MAPT carriers being assigned to the mild frontotemporal subtype associated with C9orf72 carriers. See also Supplementary Table 2.\nSuStaIn subtypes and stages have predictive utility in AD.

A largely independent Alzheimer’s disease data set (only 59 subjects are in both the 576 subject data set used to generate this ﬁgure and the 793 subject data set used in Fig. 3) consisting of those with regional brain volume measurements from 1.5T MRI scans, rather than 3T MRI scans, are shown. Diagrams are as in Fig. 3, with the rows showing the progression pattern of one of the subtypes identiﬁed by SuStaIn. SuStaIn modelling identiﬁes three major subtypes: a typical, a cortical and a subcortical subtype, which are in good agreement with the three subtypes in Fig. 3, as well as an additional very small outlier group (only 4%) with a subtype we term parietal. This small subgroup may represent outliers with a posterior cortical atrophy phenotype\n\npredictive utility for the risk of conversion between diagnostic categories in ADNI. By ﬁtting a Cox Proportional Hazards model, we found signiﬁcant effects (t-test) of baseline SuStaIn subtype (p = 2.44 × 10−3) and stage (p = 8.76 × 10−11) on an individual’s risk of conversion from MCI to AD. Of the SuStaIn subtypes, the subcortical subtype is associated with the lowest risk of conversion, while the typical subtype is associated with the highest risk of conversion. Supplementary Table 3 shows that SuStaIn outperforms subtypes-only and stages-only models at estimating the risk of conversion between diagnostic categories in ADNI. By performing likelihood ratio tests comparing SuStaIn to subtypesonly and stages-only we ﬁnd that SuStaIn provides a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt (likelihood ratio test) than both subtypes-only (p = 3.96 × 10−5) and stages-only (p = 7.18 × 10−4) models. This shows that both the subtypes and stages estimated by SuStaIn provide additional information for predicting the risk of conversion from MCI to AD.\nDiscussion In this study we introduce SuStaIn—a powerful tool for data-driven disease phenotype discovery, providing insights into disease aetiology, and enhanced power for patient stratiﬁcation in clinical\n\ntrials and healthcare. Results from the GENFI data set ﬁrst validate that SuStaIn can successfully recover known distinct progression patterns in genetic FTD corresponding to different genotypes. Moreover, SuStaIn identiﬁes and characterises within-group heterogeneity for carriers of a mutation in the C9orf72 gene as distinct temporal progression patterns in two subtypes. The results demonstrate the utility of SuStaIn for data-driven disease phenotype discovery, and provide biological insight into the C9orf72 mutation. Application of SuStaIn to the 3T ADNI data set recovers three distinct AD subtypes with ﬁnal stages that reﬂect post-mortem neuropathological ﬁndings. Results from a largely independent AD data set (ADNI 1.5T) corroborate these three subtypes. The disease subtype characterisation SuStaIn provides goes much further than post-mortem neuropathological studies3,28, or other machinelearning techniques23, by characterising the temporal trajectory of each subtype, enabling in vivo stratiﬁcation of subjects by disease stage as well as disease subtype. We demonstrate the ability of SuStaIn to stratify in vivo by both subtype and stage in genetic FTD and AD. In genetic FTD, we show that the SuStaIn neuroimaging subtypes can distinguish affected carriers belonging to different genetic groups with high classiﬁcation accuracy.

Each scatter plot visualises the probability that each individual belongs to each of the SuStaIn subtypes estimated for a genetic frontotemporal dementia (as shown in Fig. 2a), and b. Alzheimer’s disease (as shown in Fig. 3).

The asymmetric frontal lobe subtype and temporal lobe subtype in Fig. 2 show clear similarities with previous studies of regional volume loss in GRN and MAPT mutation carriers respectively. However, SuStaIn provides much greater detail and accuracy by avoiding reliance on crude a priori\n\nstaging, e.g. via mean familial age of onset. The frontotemporal lobe subtype and subcortical subtype in Fig. 2 both have features previously associated with C9orf72 mutation carriers, but SuStaIn assigns these features to two distinct disease subtypes, and further reveals the temporal progression of each subtype.\nSeveral biological factors may produce the two subtypes observed in C9orf72 mutation carriers, either individually or in combination. Clinically, while there is signiﬁcant overlap, patients typically present with either a behavioural variant FTD or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as their main phenotype31, and they can progress at various rates; genetically, the expansion length is variable and there are additional genetic modiﬁers (e.g. TMEM106B and ATXN2) that alter phenotype32–34; and pathologically, most cases have either type A or type B TDP-43\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2018)9:4273\n\n| DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\n7\n\nARTICLE\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0\n\nTable 3 Utility of SuStaIn subtype and stage for predicting the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease\n\nS–C–T S–C C–T S–T\n\nSuStaIn subtype\n1.57** 1.76~ 1.48~ 2.11*\n\nSuStaIn\nstage\n1.13† 1.16† 1.11† 1.13†\n\nAge Sex Education APOE4\n\n0.98 0.95* 0.98 1.02\n\n0.98 1.03 0.87 1.13\n\n0.93~ 0.92 0.97 0.90*\n\n1.82†\n1.53* 1.84† 2.13†\n\nEach row shows Hazards ratios for a different Cox Proportional Hazards model that estimates the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease using ADNI data. Each column shows the estimated hazard ratio for each variable. Each hazards ratio tells you\nhow the risk of conversion changes for each unit increase of a particular variable: a ratio of 1 means no modiﬁcation of the risk, a ratio >1 means there is an increase of the risk, and a ratio less than 1 means there is a reduction of the risk. For the ﬁrst model (S–C–T) it is assumed that the hazard ratio increases multiplicatively from the Subcortical subtype (S) to the Cortical subtype (C) to the Typical subtype (T), i.e. the S–C–T model estimates that each SuStaIn subtype has a hazards ratio 1.57 times that of the previous subtype (i.e. the cortical group have a\n1.57 times greater risk of conversion than the subcortical group, the typical group have a 1.57\ntimes greater risk of conversion than the cortical group, and the typical group have a 2.46 (1.572) times greater risk of conversion than the subcortical group). In the remaining models\nonly two groups are compared at a time to demonstrate that the results are similar without this\nassumption, although the statistical power is reduced. This result demonstrates the added utility\nof both disease subtypes and stages obtained from SuStaIn for predicting conversion between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, with both subtype and stage modifying the risk of conversion.

There is no notion of disease stage in the subtypes-only model\n\npathology31. While further study is required to determine the biological factors that inﬂuence neuroanatomical phenotype, these ﬁndings demonstrate the power of SuStaIn in identifying hitherto unrecognised disease subtypes using clinical data, and thus open up the potential to link variations in genetics, pathology and neuroanatomy.\nWe also ﬁnd evidence for the presence of a subsidiary group in the MAPT mutation carriers, but numbers are too small to determine whether this group have a distinct progression pattern. Among individuals with signiﬁcant evidence of MRI atrophy (SuStaIn stage of ≥5), four individuals (two pairs of individuals from the same families) of 13 were identiﬁed as belonging to the subsidiary group. Although MAPT mutations have been commonly thought to have a very speciﬁc pattern of atrophy affecting the anterior and medial temporal lobes predominantly, one previous paper has shown that there can be a second pattern of atrophy in speciﬁc mutations, where the lateral temporal lobes are affected more than the medial regions35. Interestingly, the two pairs of individuals who constitute the subsidiary group in our analysis all have P301L mutations, a mutation that falls into this second alternate atrophy pattern group in ref. 35. None of the nine individuals assigned to the predominant progression pattern in our analysis have P301L mutations, or V337M mutations, the other mutation identiﬁed in ref. 35 as having an alternate atrophy\n\npattern. This suggests that SuStaIn may be able to identify particular MAPT mutations that fall into this alternate group, but larger studies will be required to conﬁrm this.\nIn AD, post-mortem histology3 and retrospectively analysed MRI scans close to the time of death28 observe three distinct patterns of atrophy in late-stage AD patients: one focussed on the temporal lobe that is similar to the late stages of the typical SuStaIn subtype; one affecting predominantly cortical regions cf. late stages of the cortical SuStaIn subtype; and one with stronger subcortical involvement cf. late stages of the subcortical SuStaIn subtype. This gives conﬁdence in the SuStaIn subtypes, which provide much greater information by revealing the progression of each subtype over time, including the earliest sites of regional volume loss. Moreover, and importantly for practical utility, the SuStaIn subtypes can be assigned in vivo using MRI, enabling linkage of late-stage pathological observations with early-stage neurodegeneration.\nThe three AD subtypes found in the 3T MRI data set are corroborated by the largely independent 1.5T MRI data set. However, some small differences arise between the subtype progression patterns of the three subtypes recovered in each data set. These differences lie predominantly in how early the nucleus accumbens begins to atrophy in the different subtypes: across all three subtypes the nucleus accumbens shows atrophy earlier in the 3T subtypes than the 1.5T subtypes. A possible explanation for this is that the volume of the nucleus accumbens, which is relatively small, can be estimated more accurately using the higher ﬁeld strength 3T MRI scans than the 1.5T MRI scans, and thus atrophy in the nucleus accumbens can be identiﬁed from an earlier stage in the 3T data set compared to the 1.5T data set.\nIn the 1.5T MRI data set we additionally ﬁnd a small proportion (4%) of outliers with a parietal subtype. This small subgroup may represent a posterior cortical atrophy phenotype: comparing the Alzheimer’s disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAScog) scores between individuals with an AD diagnosis that are assigned to the parietal subgroup (N = 6) and the typical AD subgroup (N = 65), we ﬁnd that the parietal subgroup have worse performance (Mann–Whitney U test) on certain praxic (Q6. Ideational Praxis, p = 6.1 × 10−3, z = 2.7) and spatiallydemanding (Q14. Number Cancellation, p = 4.9 × 10−3, z = 2.8) subtests, but similar performance (Mann–Whitney U test) in memory domains (Q8. Word Recognition, p = 0.81, z = −0.2; Q1. Word Recall, p = 0.48, z = 0.70). Additionally, the parietal subgroup is on average 10.3 years younger (p = 2.8 × 10−3, z = −3.0, Mann–Whitney U test) than the typical AD subgroup.\nThe temporal spreading patterns for distinct subtypes estimated by SuStaIn offer biological insight. For example, the progression pattern of each subtype provides a view of how neurodegeneration spreads from a distinct origin over the rest of the brain that is uncorrupted by phenotypic heterogeneity. A key advantage of SuStaIn is that it provides a purely data-driven, hypothesis-free, reconstruction of the progression of neurodegenerative disease subtypes. However, these observations also have great potential to inform mechanistic models36,37 of neurodegenerative disease, which explain their temporal progression via various hypothetical mechanisms of disease propagation over brain networks. Current mechanistic models implicitly assume a single-disease progression pattern—an assumption often violated in patient data sets, but much more reasonable if focussed on particular SuStaIn subtypes.\nSuStaIn shows strong capabilities for patient stratiﬁcation in AD, which we are able to validate in genetic FTD where we expect the subtype assignments to correspond to distinct genotypes. SuStaIn provides high classiﬁcation accuracy for differentiating the different mutation types in genetic FTD, and the AD subtypes are clearly assignable. In genetic FTD, SuStaIn out-performs a\n\n8\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2018)9:4273\n\n| DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0\n\nARTICLE\n\nsubtypes-only model, giving a balanced classiﬁcation accuracy of 86% for distinguishing genotype compared to 69% for the subtypes-only model. This provides compelling evidence that there is substantial heterogeneity in disease stage within different phenotypes, and that modelling this disease stage heterogeneity is important for better patient stratiﬁcation. This is further demonstrated in AD, in which SuStaIn’s subtypes and stages substantially out-perform subtypes-only and stages-only models for predicting conversion between diagnostic categories. These early results are highly promising, particularly given that the particular choice of biomarkers used here (coarse regional brain volumes) is not optimised for stratiﬁcation. In this initial study, we chose to use MRI to maximise the number of subjects with all available measurements, to simplify the interpretation of the results, and to enhance the clinical utility. However, future work will test the added beneﬁt of including a wider range of biomarkers and a more ﬁne-grained set of regional volumes in SuStaIn for patient stratiﬁcation. For example in AD, incorporation of amyloid and neuroﬁbrillary tangle measures, e.g. from amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans, will enable stratiﬁcation of individuals at the very earliest disease stages.\nThe previous study of Zhang et al.23 also looked at the assignment of AD subtypes using a subtypes-only model that does not account for temporal heterogeneity in disease stage. In contrast to the study of Zhang et al.23, we observe strong assignment of AD patients to the subtypes (Fig. 5b) emphasising the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in disease stage. This assignability clearly increases with disease progression, with the subtypes being most strongly assigned in clinically diagnosed AD patients. However, even at early stages (MCI), many subjects cluster around the vertices of the triangles showing strong potential for identifying early-stage cohorts representative of each subtype.\nThe model underlying SuStaIn makes several assumptions to enable the simultaneous estimation of subtypes and their progression. One assumption is that biomarker variance is independent. In reality biomarkers tend to co-vary due to shared biological processes. However, simulation experiments (Supplementary Figure 7) show that the subtype progression patterns recovered by SuStaIn are robust to biomarker covariance. Nevertheless, reﬁnements might come from modelling covariance among strongly dependent biomarkers, e.g. using model selection criteria to identify a minimal set of necessary covariance parameters, and future work will explore this idea.\nTo enable the modelling of purely cross-sectional data, here we make an assumption of an arbitrary timescale. This formulation can also work with longitudinal data when available, although here we reserve the longitudinal information to validate the clinical utility of SuStaIn to make future predictions at an individual’s ﬁrst visit. However, extensions to SuStaIn that utilise longitudinal information to further provide a well-deﬁned timescale are an important area for future work.\nHere we make a further implicit assumption that the cohort is correctly diagnosed. While the genetic tests in GENFI ensure this, the clinical diagnoses of AD in ADNI are less reliable and the proportion of misdiagnosis, e.g. of depression or other neurological diseases, is non-negligible. Simulation of the effect of misdiagnosis (Supplementary Figure 9) demonstrates that SuStaIn can robustly recover subtype progression patterns under a substantial proportion of outliers, up to 20%. Nevertheless, future adaptions of the SuStaIn model might include a broad outlier class to capture individuals that do not ﬁt any of the main clusters.\nOne caveat on the ﬁndings is that the underlying data may come from a spectrum of disease progression patterns, rather\n\nthan a set of distinct trajectories as SuStaIn is designed to estimate. Simulations (Supplementary Figure 11) demonstrate that SuStaIn may still recover multiple distinct progression patterns from data generated by a spectrum of progression patterns. In this case the distinct progression patterns identiﬁed by SuStaIn still provide useful information about the extrema within the underlying spectrum of progression patterns. Here, however, the alignment with genotypes in genetic FTD and neuropathological observations in AD provide conﬁdence that the distinct subtypes are genuine. Future work will extend SuStaIn to be able to represent spectra of progression patterns (e.g. using Mallow’s models as in refs. 38,39).\nWe introduce SuStaIn—a tool to disentangle and characterise the temporal and phenotypic heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases. We use it to elucidate the temporal and phenotypic heterogeneity of both genetic FTD and AD subtypes with previously unseen detail. We further demonstrate SuStaIn’s potential as a patient stratiﬁcation tool in AD by showing strong alignment of subjects with speciﬁc subtypes even at early disease stages, as well as added power to predict conversion between clinical diagnoses. SuStaIn has the potential to make substantial clinical impact as a tool for precision medicine and is readily applicable to any progressive disease, including other neurodegenerative diseases, respiratory diseases and cancers.\nMethods\nGENFI data set. We used cross-sectional volumetric MRI data from GENFI (http://www.genﬁ.org.uk/). Subjects were included from the second data freeze of GENFI, which in total consisted of 365 participants recruited across 13 centres in the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden and Portugal. A total of 313 participants had a usable volumetric T1-weighted MRI scan for analysis (15 participants did not have a scan and the other participants were excluded as the scans were of unsuitable quality due to motion, other imaging artefacts or pathology unlikely to be attributed to FTD). The 313 participants included 141 non-carriers, 123 presymptomatic carriers and 49 symptomatic carriers. Of the 123 presymptomatic mutation carriers there were 62 GRN, 39 C9orf72 and 22 MAPT carriers. Of the 49 symptomatic carriers, there were 14 GRN, 24 C9orf72 and 11 MAPT carriers. The acquisition and post-processing procedures for GENFI have been previously described in ref. 29. Brieﬂy, cortical and subcortical volumes were generated using a multi-atlas segmentation propagation approach40, combining cortical regions of interest to calculate grey matter volumes of the entire cortex, separated into the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, cingulate and insula cortices. In addition to regional volumetric measures, we also included a measure of asymmetry, which is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the volumes of the right and left hemispheres, normalised by the total volume of both hemispheres. This asymmetry measure was log transformed to improve normality. See Supplementary Table 4 for a summary of the biomarkers used in the SuStaIn modelling.\nADNI data set. Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni. usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-proﬁt organisations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. For up-to-date information, see http://www.adni-info.org. Written consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating institution.\nWe downloaded data from Laboratory Of Neuro Imaging (LONI; http://adni. loni.usc.edu) on 11 May 2016 and constructed two cross-sectional volumetric MRI data sets for SuStaIn model ﬁtting: those with higher (3T) and lower (1.5T) ﬁeld strength. The inclusion criteria for the 3T and 1.5T data sets were having crosssectional FreeSurfer volumes available that passed overall quality control from either a 3T (processed using FreeSurfer Version 5.1) or a 1.5T (processed using FreeSurfer Version 4.3) MRI scan. The 3T data set consisted of 793 subjects (183 CN, 86 signiﬁcant memory concern, 243 early MCI, 164 late MCI, 117 AD), of which 73 were enroled in ADNI-1, 99 were enroled in ADNI-GO and 621 were enroled in ADNI-2. The 1.5T data set consisted of 576 ADNI-1 subjects (180 CN, 274 late MCI, 122 AD). The 1.5T and 3T data sets are largely independent: only 59 subjects (14 CN, 33 late MCI, 12 AD) have both 1.5T and 3T scans. We downloaded processed cross-sectional FreeSurfer volumes for 1.5T and 3T scans, using FreeSurfer Versions 4.3 and 5.1, and quality control ratings. We retained only the volumes that passed overall quality control, and normalised them by regressing against total intracranial volume. We further downloaded demographic\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2018)9:4273\n\n| DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\n9\n\nARTICLE\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0\n\ninformation for covariate correction: age, sex, education and APOE genotype from the ADNIMERGE table. We downloaded diagnostic follow-up information to test the association of the SuStaIn model subtypes and stages with longitudinal outcomes. We also downloaded baseline cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) measurements of Aβ1–42, which we used to identify a control population. Again, see Supplementary Table 4 for a summary of the biomarkers used in the SuStaIn modelling.\nz-scores. We expressed each regional volume measurement as a z-score relative to a control population: in GENFI we used data from all non-carriers, in ADNI we used amyloid-negative CN subjects, deﬁned as those with a CSF Aβ1–42 measurement >192 pg per ml41. This gave us a control population of 48 amyloidnegative CN subjects for the 3T data set, and 56 amyloid-negative CN subjects for the 1.5T data set. We used these control populations to determine whether the effects of age, sex, education or number of APOE4 alleles (ADNI only) were signiﬁcant, and if so to regress them out. We then normalised each data set relative to its control population, so that the control population had a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Because regional brain volumes decrease over time the z-scores become negative with disease progression, so for simplicity we took the negative value of the z-scores so that the z-scores would increase as the brain volumes became more abnormal.\nSuStaIn modelling. We formulate the model underlying SuStaIn as groups of subjects with distinct patterns of biomarker evolution (see Mathematical Model). We refer to a group of subjects with a particular biomarker progression pattern as a subtype. The biomarker evolution of each subtype is described as a linear z-score model in which each biomarker follows a piecewise linear trajectory over a common timeframe. The noise level for each biomarker is assumed constant over the timeframe and is derived from a control population (see Mathematical model). This linear z-score model is based on the event-based model in refs. 7,8,38, but reformulates the events so that they represent the continuous linear accumulation of a biomarker from one z-score to another, rather than an instantaneous switch from a normal to an abnormal level. A key advantage of this formulation is that it can work with purely cross-sectional data because it requires no information about the timescale of change, but instead uses events as control points of piecewise linear segments with arbitrary duration. The model ﬁtting considers increasing number of subtypes C, for which we estimate the proportion of subjects f that belong to each subtype, and the order SC in which biomarkers reach each z-score for each subtype c = 1 … C. We determine the optimal number of subtypes C for a particular data set through ten-fold cross-validation (see Cross-validation).\nMathematical model. The linear z-score model underlying SuStaIn is a continuous generalisation of the original event-based model7,8, which we describe ﬁrst.\nThe event-based model in refs. 7,8 describes disease progression as a series of events, where each event corresponds to a biomarker transitioning from a normal to an abnormal level. The occurrence of an event, Ei, for biomarker i = 1 … I, is informed by the measurements xij of biomarker i in subject j, j = 1 … J. The whole data set X = {xij | i = 1 … I, j = 1 … J} is the set of measurements of each biomarker in each subject. The most likely ordering of the events is the sequence S that maximises the data likelihood\n\n\" YJ XI\n\nYk     YI  \n\n !#\n\nPðXjSÞ ¼\n\nPðkÞ P xijjEi\n\nP xijj:Ei ;\n\nð1Þ\n\nj¼1 k¼0\n\ni¼1\n\ni¼kþ1\n\nwhere P(x | Ei) and P(x | ¬Ei) are the likelihoods of measurement x given that biomarker i has or has not become abnormal, respectively. P(k) is the prior\n\nlikelihood of being at stage k, at which the events E1, ..., Ek have occurred, and the events Ek+1, …, EI have yet to occur. The model uses a uniform prior on the stage, so that P(k) = 1/(I + 1), k = 0 … I, i.e. a priori individuals are equally likely to\n\nbelong to any stage along the progression pattern. The likelihoods P(x | Ei) and P(x\n\n| ¬Ei) are modelled as normal distributions. The linear z-score model we use in this work reformulates the event-based\n\nmodel in (1) by replacing the instantaneous normal to abnormal events with events\n\nthat represent the (more biologically plausible) linear accumulation of a biomarker\n\nfrom one z-score to another.

Supplementary Figure 15 provides a ﬂowchart detailing the processes involved in the SuStaIn model ﬁtting. Model ﬁtting requires simultaneously optimising subtype membership, subtype trajectory and the posterior distributions of both. In particular, the cost function here depends on the sequence ordering, which to our knowledge standard algorithms do not handle. We therefore derive our own algorithm to ﬁt SuStaIn, based on the well-established methods developed for the event-based model (7,8,42,43), for which we demonstrate convergence and optimality in simulation (see Supplementary Results: Convergence) and in the data sets used here (see Convergence). As shown in the black box in Supplementary Figure 15, the SuStaIn model is ﬁtted hierarchically, with the number of clusters being estimated via model selection criteria obtained from cross-validation. The hierarchical ﬁtting initialises the ﬁtting of each C-cluster (subtype) model from the previous C-1-cluster model, i.e. the clustering problem is solved sequentially from C = 1 … Cmax (where Cmax is the maximum number of clusters being ﬁtted), initialising each model using the previous model. For the initial cluster (C = 1), we use the single-cluster expectation maximisation (E-M) procedure shown in the green box in Supplementary Figure 15, and described subsequently. We ﬁt subsequent cluster numbers (C > 1) hierarchically by generating C-1 candidate Ccluster models using the split-cluster E-M procedure shown in the blue box in Supplementary Figure 15, and described subsequently. From these C-1 candidate C-cluster models, the model with the highest likelihood is chosen.\nThe split-cluster E-M procedure shown in the blue box in Supplementary Figure 15 is used to generate each of the C-1 candidate C cluster models. For each of the C-1 clusters, the split-cluster E-M procedure ﬁrst ﬁnds the optimal split of cluster c into two clusters. To ﬁnd the optimal split of cluster c into two clusters, the data points belonging to cluster c are randomly assigned to two separate clusters. The optimal model parameters for these two data subsets are then obtained using the single-cluster E-M procedure (green box in Supplementary Figure 15). These cluster parameters are used to initialise the ﬁtting of a two-cluster model to the subset of the data belonging to cluster c, using E-M. This two-cluster solution is then used together with the other C-2 clusters to initialise the ﬁtting of the Ccluster model. The C-cluster model is then optimised using E-M, alternating between updating the sequences Sc for each cluster and the fractions fc. This procedure is repeated for 25 different start points (random cluster assignments) to ﬁnd the maximum likelihood solution (see Convergence).\nThe single-cluster E-M procedure shown in the green box in Supplementary Figure 15 is used to ﬁnd the optimal model parameters (the sequence S in which the biomarkers reach each z-score) for a single-cluster. In the single-cluster E-M procedure the sequence S is initialised randomly. This sequence is then optimised using E-M by going through each z-score event E in turn and ﬁnding its optimal position in the sequence relative to the other z-score events, i.e. by ﬁxing the order of the subsequence T = S/E and maximising the likelihood of the sequence by changing the position of event e in the subsequence T. The sequence S is updated until convergence. Again the single-cluster sequence S is optimised from 25\n\n10\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2018)9:4273\n\n| DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05892-0\n\nARTICLE\n\ndifferent random starting sequences to ﬁnd the maximum likelihood solution (see Convergence).\nConvergence. At several points in the model ﬁtting we perform a greedy optimisation from a number of different starting points and choose the maximum likelihood sequence or set of sequences. The multiple runs safeguard against local minima. However, in fact, we ﬁnd that the optimisation displays good convergence: runs from all start points typically converge to a solution with likelihood within a 1 × 10−3 % of the maximum likelihood, and within the uncertainty estimated by the uncertainty estimation procedure (see Uncertainty estimation). The convergence of the SuStaIn algorithm and ability to locate the global minimum and correct solution is further demonstrated in simulation using synthetic data in (Supplementary Results: Convergence).\nUncertainty estimation. In addition to estimating the most probable sequence Sc for each subtype, we can determine the relative likelihood of all sequences for each subtype by evaluating the probability of each possible sequence. This gives us an estimate of the uncertainty in the ordering Sc, which we summarise by plotting the probability that each z-score event appears at each position in the sequence for each subtype. We visualise this probability (see Fig. 2 for example) using different colours to indicate the cumulative probability each region has reached a particular z-score: the cumulative probability of a region going from a z-score of 0-sigma to 1sigma ranges from 0 in white to 1 in red, the cumulative probability of a region going from a z-score of 1-sigma to 2-sigma ranges from 0 in red to 1 in magenta, and the cumulative probability of a region going from a z-score of 2-sigma to 3sigma ranges from 0 in magenta to 1 in blue. In practise the number of sequences is too large to evaluate all possible sequences so we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to provide an approximation to this uncertainty, as in7,8. As in refs. 7,8, we take 1,000,000 MCMC samples initialised from the maximum likelihood solution, checking that the MCMC trace shows good mixing properties.\nCross-validation. We use ten-fold cross-validation here for two distinct purposes: (i) to evaluate the optimal number of subtypes and (ii) to evaluate the consistency of the subtype progression patterns. We evaluated the optimal number of subtypes using the Cross-Validation Information Criterion (CVIC)44, i.e. by evaluating the likelihood of each c-subtype model from c = 1 … C on the test data for each fold and choosing the model with the highest out-of-sample likelihood P(X | M), or equivalently the lowest value of the CVIC, across all folds. The CVIC is deﬁned as CVIC = −2 × log(P(X | M)), where P(X | M) is the probability of the data for a\nPC particular SuStaIn model, M, i.e. P(X | M) = PðXjScÞPðScÞ. In cases where the\nc¼1\nevidence for a more complex model was not strong (a difference of less than 6 between the CVIC and the minimum CVIC across models, or equivalently a difference of less than 3 between the out-of-sample log-likelihood and the minimum out-of-sample log-likelihood across models), we favoured the less complex model to avoid over-ﬁtting45. To evaluate the consistency of the subtype progression patterns we performed ten-fold cross-validation by dividing the data into ten folds and re-ﬁtting the model to each subset of the data, with one of the folds retained for testing each time. We report the consistency of the models across folds by computing the similarity between the progression patterns of two subtypes (see Similarity between two subtype progression patterns): the model ﬁtted to each fold and the model ﬁtted to the whole data set.\nSimilarity between two subtype progression patterns. To enable the comparison of subtype progression patterns in data subsets (Supplementary Figure 13B) and across cross-validation folds (CVS in Figs. 2–4, and Supplementary Figures 13A and 14), we measure the similarity of pairs of subtype progression patterns using the Bhattacharyya coefﬁcient46. We evaluate the Bhattacharyya coefﬁcient between the position of each biomarker event in the two subtype progression patterns, averaged across biomarker events and MCMC samples. The Bhattacharyya coefﬁcient measures the similarity of the distribution of the position of biomarker events in the subtype sequences and ranges from 0 (maximum dissimilarity) to 1 (maximum similarity).\nPatient subtyping and staging. We assigned subjects to subtypes and stages predicted by the SuStaIn model (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 3) by ﬁrst evaluating the likelihood that they belonged to each subtype (by integrating over disease stage) and choosing the subtype with the highest likelihood, and then evaluating the probability they belonged to each stage of the most probable subtype and choosing the stage with the highest likelihood. When evaluating the likelihood we integrated over the set of MCMC samples to account for the uncertainty in the model parameters, rather than just evaluating the likelihood at the maximum likelihood parameters. This means that a patient’s model stage indicates the average position over the posterior distribution on the sequence given the data.\nStrength of assignment to subtype. We evaluated the strength of an individual’s assignment to a particular subtype by comparing the probability that they were at stage ≤2 (i.e. they had no major imaging abnormalities and therefore could not be\n\nassigned to a particular subtype) with the probability that they belonged to each SuStaIn subtype (probability for each subtype summed over stages 3+). The strength of the assignment was evaluated as their maximum probability of belonging to one of the subtypes. We considered those with a maximum probability of belonging to a particular subtype of greater than a half as having a strong assignment to a subtype.\nComparison to subtypes-only and stages-only models. We compared our SuStaIn model to a subtypes-only model and a stages-only model. In the subtypesonly model, individuals are clustered together into groups based on the similarity of their biomarker measurements—without accounting for heterogeneity in disease stage. The stages-only model is a disease progression model where all subjects are assumed to be samples of a single common progression pattern—without accounting for heterogeneity in disease subtype. We formulated the subtypes-only and stages-only models so that they were as close as possible to the SuStaIn model, but did not model heterogeneity in disease stage or disease subtype, respectively. This allows us to assess the beneﬁt of accounting for this disease stage or subtype heterogeneity in the SuStaIn model. The subtypes-only model consists of a mixture of Gaussians with unknown mean and variance. The subtypes-only model is ﬁtted to symptomatic mutation carriers for GENFI, and AD subjects for ADNI, so that the subtypes correspond to a single diagnostic group. As done for the SuStaIn model, we evaluated the optimal number of clusters (subtypes) using the CVIC44. The stages-only model is a special case of the SuStaIn model outlined in Mathematical Model, where only a single subtype is modelled, i.e. C = 1.\nSuStaIn modelling of GENFI data set. Supplementary Tables 4–6 provide a summary of the settings of the SuStaIn algorithm. We applied SuStaIn modelling to various subgroups of the GENFI data set: all 172 mutation carriers, 76 GRN mutation carriers, 63 C9orf72 mutation carriers, 33 MAPT mutation carriers. For all mutation carriers we ﬁtted SuStaIn models of up to a maximum of 5 subtypes. For the GRN, C9orf72 and MAPT mutation carriers we ﬁtted SuStaIn models of up to a maximum of 3 subtypes. We chose the z-score events for the GENFI data set to include z-scores of 1, 2 and 3 for each volume, but excluded z-score events where fewer than 10 mutation carriers had values that were greater than that z-score. The maximum zscore, which is reached at the ﬁnal stage of the progression, was set to be 2, 3 or 5 depending on whether the maximum z-score event was 1, 2 or 3, respectively. We maintained the same z-score events across each of the GENFI experiments.\nSuStaIn modelling of ADNI data set. We applied SuStaIn modelling to two largely independent (overlap of 59 individuals) subgroups of the ADNI data set: 793 individuals with 3T MRI scans and 576 individuals with 1.5T MRI scans, for which we tested SuStaIn models of up to a maximum of 5 subtypes. As we did for GENFI, we chose the z-score events to include z-scores of 1, 2 or 3 for each volume, but excluded z-score events where fewer than 10 subjects had values that were greater than that z-score. Again the maximum z-score, which is reached at the ﬁnal stage of the progression, was set to be 2, 3 or 5 depending on whether the maximum z-score event was 1, 2 or 3 respectively. Full details of the settings of the SuStaIn algorithm can be found in Supplementary Tables 4–6.\nClassiﬁcation of mutation groups using subtypes. We performed two experiments to compare the ability of subtypes obtained from SuStaIn and the subtypesonly model to classify mutation carriers in GENFI into their different mutation groups. In the ﬁrst experiment (Tables 1 and 2) we optimised the probability required for assignment to each of the subtypes. This accounts for different amounts of heterogeneity within the different subtypes. In the second experiment (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) we simply assigned individuals to their most probable subtype and compared their assigned subtype with their mutation group. In both experiments the classiﬁcation results are reported as out-of-sample accuracies obtained through 10-fold cross-validation.\nData availability\nGenetic FTD data used in this study will become available via the GENFI website (www. genﬁ.org.uk) and by application to the GENFI data access committee (email: genﬁ@ucl. ac.uk).
