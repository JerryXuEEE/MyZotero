Here, we investigated the brain functional connectivity (FC) changes following a novel accelerated theta burst stimulation protocol known as Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) which demonstrated signiﬁcant antidepressant efﬁcacy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In a sample of 24 patients (12 active and 12 sham), active stimulation was associated with signiﬁcant pre- and post-treatment modulation of three FC pairs, involving the default mode network (DMN), amygdala, salience network (SN) and striatum. The most robust ﬁnding was the SNT effect on amygdala-DMN FC (group*time interaction F(1,22) = 14.89, p < 0.001). This FC change correlated with improvement in depressive symptoms (rho (Spearman) = −0.45, df = 22, p = 0.026). The post-treatment FC pattern showed a change in the direction of the healthy control group and was sustained at the one-month follow-up. These results are consistent with amygdala-DMN connectivity dysfunction as an underlying mechanism of TRD and bring us closer to the goal of developing imaging biomarkers for TMS treatment optimization.

INTRODUCTION Failure to achieve complete remission in treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) leads to increased morbidity, relapse rates [1], and suicidality [2]. Elucidating the neural mechanisms associated with treatment response could improve therapeutics—via an approach based on personalized psychiatry [3]—and better our understanding of the neurophysiology of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Biological mechanisms in MDD have been investigated using network-level whole-brain approaches, such as functional connectivity (FC) imaging, which has led to a better understanding of biological mechanisms of MDD [3, 4]. Three core circuits have been identiﬁed in depression: the medial prefrontal–posterior cingulate default mode network (DMN), the fronto-parietal central executive network (CEN), and the cingulo-opercular salience network (SN) [5]. The latter two are known to have an inhibitory function over the DMN and a crucial role in the regulation of cognitive and emotional processes [5]. Recent ﬁndings have shown that in patients with depression, the DMN has a greater FC with dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) [6], subgenual ACC (sgACC) [7], and subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC) than in healthy controls and is associated with rumination [8]. Some work has emphasized that cognitive control and reward-related networks are associated with treatment resistance in depression [9]. Both DMN FC and anterior insula glucose metabolism predict

response to antidepressant (ATD) therapy, suggesting that there may be functional markers within both the DMN and the SN that can guide treatment selection such as pharmacotherapy or cognitive behavior therapy [10–12]. Interestingly, the literature on rTMS treatment response is converging toward using the anticorrelation between the DLPFC, a part of the CEN, and the sgACC to predict clinical outcomes [13–16]. Thus, some randomized controlled studies have emphasized that left or bilateral DLPFC TMS / intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) could be associated with modiﬁcations within and between FC of SN, CEN, and DMN. [17–20] Whereas one study failed to elicit such effect probably due to lack of statistical power [21]. However, whether TMS alters CEN and SN regulation of the DMN remains unclear.
Indeed, relatively little is known about brain functional correlates of ATD treatment. Most studies exploring this question utilize typical ATD therapies, which are inherently confounded by nonspeciﬁc factors due to the duration of time between initiation and ATD effect. More recently, other pharmacological agents like ketamine and psilocybin have demonstrated rapid ATD effects, suggesting that they may be able to help address this issue. However, the contribution of these drugs in the study of the mechanisms of action might be limited by non-speciﬁc pharmacological action [22, 23] and lack of effective blinding—i.e. poorly assessed and unsuccessful [24]—which impairs the generalizability

treatment [25]. While the efﬁcacy of TMS in general [26] and SNT [25, 27] in particular have been investigated, less is known about the downstream neural effects of treatment response. Therefore, the efﬁcacy, rapidity, and durability of SNT suggest that it is an ideal therapeutic paradigm to investigate functional changes

Furthermore, the recent RCT with an intact blind allows us to investigate the downstream effects of ATD treatment while controlling for many of the concerns noted above.

To this end, we investigated the effects of active Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy—as compared to sham stimulation— on FC immediately after 5 days of treatment. Next, we examined

MRI image data acquisition and preprocessing All participants were screened for MRI safety prior to any scanning procedures. MRI scans were acquired, and clinical assessments were performed on the same day. Each participant underwent identical baseline and post-treatment MRI scans consisting of structural and resting-state functional MRI acquisitions. All MRI scans were acquired using a 3TGE Discovery MR750 scanner with a 32-channel head-neck imaging coil at the

We hypothesized that active stimulation would be associated with signiﬁcant changes in FC from baseline to the immediate-post visit and that these FC changes would be associated with the extent of clinical change. As exploratory hypotheses, we postulated that 1/ the FC at baseline would differ between TRD participants and

High-resolution structural images using GE’s BRAVO sequence (threedimensional, T1-weighted) were acquired for the whole brain (FOV = 256 × 256mm; matrix=256 × 256 voxel; slice thickness = 0.9 mm; TR = 2530 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, ﬂip angle = 7°).

Relationship between FC changes and depression severity changes from baseline to post-treatment In this analysis, we tested whether any FC changes induced by SNT were correlated with clinical changes. We found that changes in two of three FC pairs (Table 1) were signiﬁcantly associated with change in depression severity as measured by the MADRS (Fig. 2). Speciﬁcally, the left AMY (superﬁcial)—left DMN (prefrontal cortex 3) FC pair exhibited a negative correlation (rho(Spearman) = −0.45, df = 22, p = 0.026) between FC changes and MADRS changes. That is, the greater the increase in FC, the less depressed the participant became after SNT. Conversely, the right AMY (superﬁcial)—left SN (medial 3) FC pair exhibited a positive correlation (rho (Spearman)=0.49, df = 22, p = 0.015) between FC changes and MADRS changes, meaning that the greater the decrease, the less depressed the participant became after SNT. No FC pairs demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant correlation with sham SNT.
Exploratory hypotheses We performed further analyses to test (1) whether FC at baseline differed between TRD participants and healthy controls and, if so, whether the FC changes induced by active stimulation eliminated this difference, and (2) if the induced FC changes in the active group immediately post-stimulation were sustained at one month.
FC z-score comparison between active group post-treatment and HC Two pairs (of three) exhibited immediate-post mean FC z-scores in the active group that were not statistically different from the mean FC z-scores in the healthy control group (Fig. 2). These pairs were the left AMY (superﬁcial)—left DMN (prefrontal cortex 3) (t(14.56) = −1.19, Bonferroni corrected p = 1) and the right STR (sensorimotor)—right SN (frontal-operculum-insula 1) (t (27.57) = 0.81, Bonferroni corrected p = 1). Interestingly, the baseline left AMY (superﬁcial)—left DMN (prefrontal cortex 3) FC z-score was signiﬁcantly lower than the HC group (t(24.87) = −7.07, Bonferroni corrected p ≤ 0.001), suggesting that active stimulation changed AMY-DMN FC in the direction of the HC group. For more details on the post-hoc paired t-tests see supplementary Tables S6, S7, S8.

DISCUSSION The present study examined brain functional connectivity changes in TRD patients participating in a clinical trial of SNT. By using an RCT design and performing analyses of the interaction between the treatment effect (before vs. after treatment) and the group effect (active vs. sham), we explored the functional response to treatment while controlling for placebo effects. Our pre-deﬁned ROI approach identiﬁed three seed pairs with statistically signiﬁcant changes with SNT. First, amygdala-DMN FC signiﬁcantly increased from baseline to immediate-post after active SNT as compared to sham, and greater increases correlated with better clinical outcomes. Subsequent exploratory analysis was consistent with a possible normalization of pathological baseline FC. Second, amygdala-SN FC signiﬁcantly decreased from baseline to immediate-post after active SNT as compared to sham. Again, greater decreases correlated with better outcomes. Third, striatum-SN FC signiﬁcantly increased from baseline to immediate-post after active SNT as compared to sham. These results offer a unique insight into the putative mechanisms underlying the ATD effect of SNT—a high dose, fMRI-guided, accelerated intermittent TBS protocol—in TRD. Overall, our study conﬁrmed that from a dimensional perspective the DLPFC targeted TMS is efﬁcacious on depressive symptoms, as demonstrated recently in a transdiagnosis meta-analysis [42], and evidenced that the antidepressant effect associated with SNT protocol may be mediated by regional brain FC within DMN, amygdala, striatum, and SN.
Our ﬁndings highlight a central role of altered DMN FC as a mechanism of therapeutic effect and raise the possibility that this change could serve as a biomarker of therapeutic outcomes following SNT. DMN FC has been frequently reported to be abnormal in MDD but with inconsistencies in the differences observed [6, 43]. For example, contrary to the currently favored hypothesis of DMN hyperconnectivity in MDD [6], one recent large trial reported a decrease within DMN FC to be characteristic of patients suffering from recurrent MDD as compared to healthy controls [43]. Further, DMN functional activity has been linked with key MDD clinical components such as self-referential thinking [6, 44] and is hypothesized to be involved in pharmacological and nonpharmacological antidepressant mechanisms of action [45–48]. Increases within and between DMN intrinsic connectivity have been elicited in patients who remitted from depression [49], and an association between DMN-related connectivity and response—to both DLPFC [18, 50] and DMPFC [51] TMS—also has been reported. Notably, in Liston and al. study, baseline FC between sgACC and DMN was abnormally elevated in MDD patients, as compared to controls, and a full 5-week course of conventional TMS normalized this abnormal FC pattern [50]. Others have reported that the ATD effect following ketamine [52] or ATD medications [53] is associated with decreased DMN-CEN connectivity, while another study found an increased DMN-STR FC after 2 weeks of duloxetine treatment with FC changes correlating with symptom improvement [54]. Lastly, ketamine infusions (as compared to placebo) increased DMN-SN connectivity, which normalized as compared to healthy controls [55].
Antidepressant effects previously have been associated with a decrease within DMN FC [5, 10–12] as well as between DMN FC (CEN [53] and STR [54]), but we did not detect any such changes here. One possible explanation is the conservative p-value
