As an illustration, we use a soft actor-critic algorithm and find approximate solutions to the truncated crossing equations of two-dimensional CFTs, successfully identifying well-known theories like the 2D Ising model and the 2D CFT of a compactified scalar. Our methods can perform efficient high-dimensional searches that can be used to study arbitrary (unitary or nonunitary) CFTs in any spacetime dimension. \n \n    Received 3 September 2021 \n    Revised 15 October 2021 \n    Accepted 8 November 2021 \n \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.041601 \n \nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.
