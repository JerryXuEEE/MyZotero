Introduction\n\n2\n\nAltered cognitive function due to various neuropsychiatric disorders seems to result from aberrant neural dynamics in the affected brain [1–4]. Alterations in brain dynamics may also occur in the absence of disorders, in situations such as typical ageing, traumatic experiences, emotional responses and tasks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides information on the neural dynamics in the brain with a reasonable spatial resolution in a non-invasive manner. There are various analysis methods that can be used to extract the dynamics in neuroimaging data including fMRI signals, such as sliding-window functional connectivity analysis, dynamic causal modelling, oscillation analysis and biophysical modelling. In this study, we seek the potential of a different approach: energy landscape analysis.\nThis method is rooted in statistical physics. The main idea is to map the brain dynamics to the movement of a ‘ball’ constrained on an energy landscape inferred from neural data. A ball tends to go downhill and remains near the bottom of a basin in a landscape, whereas it sometimes goes uphill due to random ﬂuctuations that cause it to wander around and possibly transit to another basin (ﬁgure 1g). Using the Ising model (equivalent to the Boltzmann machine and the pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM); see [5–7] for reviews in neuroscience), we can explicitly construct an energy landscape from multivariate time-series data including fMRI signals recorded at a speciﬁed set of regions of interest (ROIs). The pairwise MEM, or, equivalently, the Ising model, has been used to emulate fMRI signals [6,8–11]. More recently, we have used the pairwise MEM for fMRI data during rest [12] and sleep [13] and then developed an energy landscape analysis method and applied it to participants during rest [14] and during a bistable visual perception task [15]. In contrast with the aforementioned previous studies [6,8–11], our approach is data driven, with the parameters of the Ising model being inferred from the given data. In this paper, we review the methods and some technical details. In passing, we introduce new techniques (i.e. different inference algorithms and a Dijkstralike method). We apply the methods to publicly shared resting-state fMRI data recorded from healthy human participants to validate the new approaches and also to examine the relationship between the accuracy of ﬁt, the size of the brain system (i.e. number of ROIs) and the length of the fMRI data.\n\n2. Material and methods\nThe pipeline of the energy landscape analysis based on the pairwise MEM is illustrated in ﬁgure 1.\n\n(a) Pairwise maximum entropy model\nFirst, we specify a brain network of interest (ﬁgure 1a) and obtain resting-state (or under other conditions, which are ideally stationary) fMRI signals at the ROIs, resulting in a multivariate time series (ﬁgure 1b). We denote the number of ROIs by N.\nSecond, we binarize the fMRI signal at each time point (i.e. in each image volume) and each ROI by thresholding the signal. Then, for each ROI i (i = 1, . . . , N), we obtain a sequence of binarized signals representing the brain activity, {σi(1), . . . , σi(tmax)}, where tmax is the length of the data, σi(t) = 1 (t = 1, . . . , tmax) indicates that the ith ROI is active at time t, and σi(t) = −1 indicates that the ROI is inactive (ﬁgure 1c). The threshold is arbitrary, and we set it to the time average of σi(t) for each i. The activity pattern of the entire network at time t is given by an N-dimensional vector σ ≡ (σ1, . . . , σN) ∈ {−1, 1}N, where we have suppressed t. Note that there are 2N possible activity patterns in total. Binarization is not readily justiﬁed given continuously distributed fMRI signals. However, we previously showed that the pairwise MEM with binarized signals predicted anatomical connectivity of the brain better than other functional connectivity methods that are based on non-binarized continuous fMRI signals and that ternary as opposed to binary quantization did not help to improve the results [12].\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 22 August 2023\nfrequency energy\nfrequency energy\n\nrsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil.

Procedures of the energy landscape analysis for fMRI data. (a) ROIs are specified. (b) fMRI signals are measured at the ROIs. (c) The fMRI signal at each ROI and each time point is binarized into 1 (active) or −1 (inactive). (d) The normalized frequency is computed for each binarized activity pattern. (e) The pairwise MEM model (i.e. Boltzmann distribution) is fitted to the empirical distribution of the 2N activity patterns (equation (2.1)). The energy value is also obtained for each activity pattern (equation (2.2)). (f ) Relationships between activity patterns that are energy local minimums are summarized into a disconnectivity graph. (g) Schematic of the energy landscape. Each local minimum corresponds to the bottom of a basin. The borders between attractive basins of different local minimums are shown by the dotted curves. Any activity pattern belongs to the basin of a local minimum. Brain dynamics can be interpreted as the motion of a ‘ball’ constrained on the energy landscape. (Online version in colour.)\n\nThird, we calculate the relative frequency with which each activity pattern is visited, Pempirical(σ ) (ﬁgure 1d). To Pempirical(σ ), we ﬁt the Boltzmann distribution given by\n\nP(σ | h, J) =\n\nexp [−E(σ |h, J)] σ exp [−E(σ | h, J)] ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 22 August 2023\n\nrsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 375: 20160287\n.........................................................\n\nwhere\n\nE(σ | h, J) = −\n\nN i=1\n\nhiσi\n\n−\n\n1 2\n\nN i=1\n\nN j=1\n\nJijσiσj\n\nj=i\n\n4 (2.2)\n\nis the energy, and h = {hi} and J = {Jij} (i, j = 1, . . . , N) are the parameters of the model (ﬁgure 1e). We assume Jij = Jji and Jii = 0 (i, j = 1, . . . , N). The principle of maximum entropy imposes that we select h and J such that σi empirical = σi model and σiσj empirical = σiσj model (i, j = 1, . . . , N), where · · · empirical and · · · model represent the mean with respect to the empirical distribution (ﬁgure 1d) and the model distribution (equation (2.1)), respectively. By maximizing the entropy\nof the distribution under these constraints, we obtain the Boltzmann distribution given by\nequation (2.1). Some algorithms for the ﬁtting will be explained in §2b. Equation (2.1) indicates\nthat an activity pattern with a high energy value is not frequently visited and vice versa. Values\nof hi and Jij represent the baseline activity at the ith ROI and the interaction between the ith and jth ROIs, respectively. Equation (2.2) implies that, if hi is large, the energy is smaller with σi = 1 than with σi = −1, such that the ith ROI tends to be active.\n\n(b) Algorithms to estimate the pairwise maximum entropy model\nIn this section, we review three algorithms to estimate the parameters of the MEM, i.e. h and J.\n\n(i) Likelihood maximization\nIn the maximum-likelihood method, we solve\n\n(h, J) = arg max L(h, J),\n\n(2.3)\n\nh,J\n\nwhere L(h, J) is the likelihood given by\n\ntmax\nL(h, J) = P(σ (t) | h, J).\nt=1\n\nWe can maximize the likelihood by a gradient ascent scheme\n\nhni ew\n\n−\n\nhoi ld\n\n=\n\ntmax\n\n∂ ∂ hi\n\nlog L(h, J)\n\n=\n\n( σi empirical −\n\nσi model)\n\nand\n\nJinjew\n\n−\n\nJiojld\n\n=\n\ntmax\n\n∂ ∂ Jij\n\nlog L(h, J)\n\n=\n\n( σiσj empirical −\n\nσiσj model),\n\n(2.4) (2.5) (2.6)\n\nwhere the superscripts new and old represent the values after and before a single updating step, respectively, and (>0) is a constant. A slightly different updating scheme called the iterative\nscaling algorithm [16], where the right-hand side of equations (2.5) and (2.6) is replaced by sgn( σi ) log( σi empirical/ σi model) and sgn( σiσj ) log( σiσj empirical/ σiσj model), respectively,\nis also used sometimes [5,12,17,18]. Because equation (2.1) is concave in terms of h and J (which we can show by verifying that the Hessian of log L is a type of sign-ﬂipped covariance matrix, which\nis negative semi-deﬁnite), the gradient ascent scheme yields the maximum-likelihood estimator. Because a single updating step involves all the 2N activity patterns to calculate σi model and σiσj model, likelihood maximization is computationally costly for large N.\nOur Matlab code to calculate the maximum-likelihood estimator for arbitrary multivariate\ntime-series data is available in the electronic supplementary material.\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 22 August 2023\n\nrsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 375: 20160287\n.........................................................\n\n(ii) Pseudo-likelihood maximization\n\n5\n\nThe pseudo-likelihood maximization method approximates the likelihood function as follows:\n\ntmax N\n\nL(h, J) ≈\n\nP˜ (σi | h, J, σ /i(t)),\n\nt=1 i=1\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere P˜ represents the Boltzmann distribution for a single spin, σi, given the other σj(j = i) values ﬁxed to σ /i(t) ≡ (σ1(t), . . . , σi−1(t), σi+1(t), . . . , σN(t)) [19]. In other words,\n\nP˜ (σi|h, J, σ /i(t)) =\n\nexp[hiσi +\n\nN j=1\n\nJij\n\nσiσj(t)]\n\nj=i\nσi =−1,+1 exp[hiσi +\n\nN j=1\n\nJijσi\n\nσj\n\n(t)]\n\n.\n\nj=i\n\n(2.8)\n\nWe call the right-hand side of equation (2.7) the pseudo-likelihood. Although this is a meanﬁeld approximation neglecting the inﬂuence of σi on σj (j = i), the estimator obtained by the maximization of the pseudo-likelihood approaches the maximum-likelihood estimator as tmax → ∞ [19]. A gradient ascent updating scheme is given by\n\nhni ew − hoi ld = ( σi empirical − σi P˜ )\n\n(2.9)\n\nand\n\nJinjew − Jiojld = ( σiσj empirical − σiσj P˜ ),\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere σi P˜ and σiσj P˜ are the mean and correlation with respect to distribution P˜ (equation (2.8))\n\nand are given by\n\n⎡\n\n⎤\n\nσi\n\nP˜\n\n=\n\n1 tmax\n\ntmax t=1\n\ntanh ⎢⎢⎢⎣hi\n\n+\n\nN\nJij\nj =1\n\nσj\n\n(t)⎥⎥⎥⎦\n\nj =i\n\n(2.11)\n\nand\n\n⎡\n\n⎤\n\nσiσj\n\nP˜ =\n\n1 tmax\n\ntmax t=1\n\nσj(t) tanh ⎢⎢⎢⎣hi\n\nN\n+ Jij\nj =1\n\nσj\n\n(t)⎥⎥⎥⎦ ,\n\nj =i\n\n(2.12)\n\nrespectively. It should be noted that this updating rule circumvents the calculation of σi model\nand σiσj model, which the gradient ascent method to maximize the original likelihood uses and involves 2N terms.\n\n(iii) Minimum probability flow\n\nDifferent from the likelihood and pseudo-likelihood maximization, the minimum probability ﬂow\nmethod [20] is not based on the likelihood function. Consider relaxation dynamics of a probability distribution, P(σ ; τ ), on the 2N activity patterns whose master equation is given by\n\ndP(σ ; τ ) dτ\n\n=\n\nσ\n\n[W(σ | σ )P(σ ; τ ) − W(σ\n\n| σ )P(σ ; τ )],\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere W(σ |σ ) is a transition rate from activity pattern σ to activity pattern σ . As the initial condition, we impose P(σ ; 0) = Pempirical(σ ). By choosing\n\nW(σ |σ ) =\n\nexp[−\n\n1 2\n\n(E(σ\n\n|h,\n\nJ)\n\n−\n\nE(σ\n\n|h, J))]\n\n(σ and σ are neighbouring patterns),\n\n0\n\n(otherwise),\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere σ and σ are neighbours if they are only different at one ROI, we obtain a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo method such that P(σ ; τ ) converges to the Boltzmann distribution given by equation (2.1).\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 22 August 2023\n\nrsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 375: 20160287\n.........................................................\n\nIn the minimum probability ﬂow method, we look for h and J values for which P(σ ; τ ) changes\n\n6\n\nlittle in the relaxation dynamics at τ = 0 [20]. The idea is that only a small amount of relaxation\n\nis necessary if the initial distribution, i.e. P(σ ; 0) (=Pempirical(σ )), is sufﬁciently close to the\n\nequilibrium distribution, i.e. the Boltzmann distribution. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence\n\nbetween the empirical distribution, P(σ ; 0), and a probability distribution after an inﬁnitely small\n\nrelaxation time, P(σ ; ), is approximated as:\n\nDKL(P(σ ; 0) P(σ ; )) ≈ DKL(P(σ ; 0) P(σ ; τ ))|τ=0 +\n\ndDKL(P(σ ; 0) P(σ ; τ ))\n\ndτ\n\nτ =0\n\n=\n\nd dτ\n\nσ ∈D\n\nP(σ\n\n;\n\n0)\n\nlog\n\nP(σ ; P(σ ;\n\n0) τ)\n\ntmax\n\n=\n\nW(σ | σ (t)),\n\ntmax t=1 σ ∈Ω\\D\n\n=−\nτ =0\n\ndP(σ ; τ )\n\nσ ∈D dτ\n\nτ =0\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere DKL(P(σ ; 0) P(σ ; )) = σ ∈Ω P(σ ; 0) log[P(σ ; 0)/P(σ ; )] is the KL divergence, which quantiﬁes the discrepancy between two distributions, Ω is the set of all the 2N activity patterns and D = {σ ∈ Ω | Pempirical(σ ) > 0} is a set of activity patterns that appear at least once in the empirical data. The minimum probability ﬂow method minimizes the last quantity in equation (2.15), i.e. the probability ﬂow from activity patterns that appear in the data to the patterns that do not. Therefore, the method is not effective when N is small and tmax is large such that most activity patterns appear in the data. However, when N is large or tmax is small, this algorithm is efﬁcient in terms of the computation time and memory space [20]. A gradient descent method on DKL(P(σ ; 0) P(σ ; )) is practically used for determining h and J.\n\n(c) Accuracy indices\n\nFully describing an empirical distribution requires 2N − 1 parameters, whereas the pairwise MEM\n\nonly uses N + N(N − 1)/2 parameters. The pairwise MEM imposes that the ﬁrst two moments of\n\nσi agree between the empirical data and the model. However, the model may be inaccurate in\n\ndescribing higher-order correlations in the empirical data. Most previous studies used one or both\n\nof the following two measures to quantify the accuracy with which the MEM ﬁtted the empirical\n\ndata.\n\nThe ﬁrst measure is deﬁned by\n\nI2 IN\n\n=\n\nS1 S1\n\n− −\n\nS2 SN\n\n,\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhich ranges between 0 and 1 for the maximum-likelihood estimator, and Sk ≡ − σ ∈Ω Pk(σ ) log Pk(σ ) is the Shannon entropy of the MEM incorporating correlations up to the kth order [17,21]. The so-called independent MEM, in which we suppress any interaction between the elements (i.e.\nJij = 0 for i, j = 1, . . . , N), gives P1(σ ). The pairwise MEM gives P2(σ ). The empirical distribution (i.e. Pempirical(σ )) is identical to PN(σ ). The denominator of equation (2.16), S1 − SN ≡ IN, is referred to as the multi-information, which quantiﬁes the total contribution of the second or\nhigher order correlation to the entropy of the empirical distribution. The numerator, S1 − S2 ≡ I2, is equal to the contribution of the pairwise correlation. If I2/IN = 1, the pairwise correlation alone accounts for all the correlations present in the empirical data. If I2/IN = 0, the pairwise correlation does not deliver any information.\nThe second measure is deﬁned by\n\nr\n\n=\n\nDKL(P1(σ ) PN(σ )) − DKL(P1(σ )\n\nDKL(P2(σ ) PN(σ ))\n\nPN(σ )) .\n\n(2.17)\n\nNote that r also ranges between 0 and 1 for the maximum-likelihood estimator [5,12,22]. If the pairwise MEM produces a distribution closer to the empirical distribution than the independent MEM does, r is large. If the pairwise MEM and the independent MEM are similar in terms of the\n\nproximity to the empirical distribution, we obtain r ≈ 0. For the maximum-likelihood estimator,\n\n7\n\nwe obtain I2/IN = r [5,18].\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 22 August 2023\n\nrsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 375: 20160287\n.........................................................\n\n(d) Disconnectivity graph and energy landscape\n\nOnce we have estimated the pairwise MEM, we construct a dendrogram referred to as a disconnectivity graph [23], as shown in ﬁgure 1f. In the disconnectivity graph, a leaf (with a loose end open downwards) corresponds to an activity pattern σ that is a local minimum of the energy, i.e. an activity pattern whose frequency is higher than any other activity pattern in the neighbourhood of σ . The neighbourhood of σ is deﬁned as the set of the N activity patterns that are different from σ only at one ROI. In the disconnectivity graph, the vertical position of the endpoint of the leaf represents its energy value, which speciﬁes the frequency of appearance, with a lower position corresponding to a higher frequency. The branching structure of the disconnectivity graph describes the energy barrier between any pair of activity patterns that are local minimums. For example, to transit from local minimum α1 to local minimum α3 in ﬁgure 1f, the brain dynamics have to overcome the height of the energy barrier (shown by the double-headed arrow). If the barrier is high, transitions between the two activity patterns occur with a low frequency.\nThe disconnectivity graph is obtained by the following procedures. First, we enumerate local minimums, i.e. the activity patterns whose energy is smaller than that of all neighbours. Then, for a given pair of local minimums α and α , we consider a path connecting them, α ↔ α , where a path is a sequence of activity patterns starting from α and ending at α such that any two consecutive activity patterns on the path are neighbouring patterns. We denote by Emax(α ↔ α ) the largest energy value among the activity patterns on path α ↔ α . The brain dynamics on this path must climb up the hill to go through the activity pattern with energy Emax(α ↔ α ) to travel between α and α . Because a large energy value corresponds to a low frequency of the activity pattern, a large Emax(α ↔ α ) value implies that the frequency of switching between α and α along this path is low. Because various paths may connect α and α , we consider\n\nE¯αα\n\n= min Emax(α ↔ α\nα↔α\n\n).\n\n(2.18)\n\nIf we remove all the rarest activity patterns whose energy is equal to or larger than E¯αα , α and α\nare disconnected (i.e. no path connecting them exists). The energy barrier for the transition from α to α is given by E¯αα − E(α).\nTo calculate E¯αα , we employ a Dijkstra-like method as follows. Consider the hypercube composed of 2N activity patterns. By deﬁnition, two nodes (i.e. activity patterns) are adjacent\n\nto each other (i.e. directly connected by a link) if they are neighbouring activity patterns. Each\n\nnode has degree (i.e. number of neighbours) N. Then, ﬁx a local minimum activity pattern α and\n\nlook for E¯αα for all local minimums α . We set E¯αα = E(α) and E¯αα = E(α ) for all α that are neighbours of α. These values are ﬁnalized and will not be changed. E¯αα for the other 2N − N − 1 local minimums α are initialized to ∞. Then, we iterate the following procedures until E¯αα\n\nvalues for all the nodes α are ﬁnalized. (i) For each ﬁnalized α , update Eαα for its all unﬁnalized\n\nneighbours α using\n\nE¯nαeαw =\n\nmin{E¯oαlαd , E¯αα } E(α )\n\n(E¯αα ≥ E(α )), (E¯αα < E(α )).\n\n(2.19)\n\n(ii) Find α with the smallest unﬁnalized E¯αα value and ﬁnalize it. (iii) Repeat steps (i) and (ii). If we carry out the entire procedure for each local minimum α, we obtain E¯αα for all pairs of local\nminimums. By collecting pairs of local minimums that have the same E¯αα value, we specify a set of\nlocal minimums that should be located under the same branch. This information is sufﬁcient\n\nfor drawing the dendrogram of local minimums, i.e. the disconnectivity graph.\n\nEach local minimum has a basin of attraction in the state space, Ω. Each activity pattern,\n\ndenoted by σ , usually belongs to one of the attractive basins, which is determined as follows.\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 22 August 2023\n\nrsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil.

(ii) Repeat step (i) until a local minimum, denoted by α, is reached. We conclude\n\nthat σ belongs to the attractive basin of α. (iii) Repeat steps (i) and (ii) for all the initial activity\n\npatterns σ ∈ Ω.\n\nUsing the information on the local minimums and attractive basins, the dynamics of the\n\nactivity pattern are illustrated as the motion of a ‘ball’ on the energy landscape, as schematically\n\nshown in ﬁgure 1g as a hypothetical two-dimensional landscape. The local minimums and energy\n\nbarriers in ﬁgure 1g correspond to those shown in the disconnectivity graph (ﬁgure 1f ).\n\n(e) 0/1 versus 1/ − 1\n\nWe remark on two binarization schemes. In statistical physics, the pairwise MEM, or the Ising\n\nmodel, usually employs σi ∈ {−1, 1} (i = 1, . . . , N) rather than σ˜i ∈ {0, 1}. The former convention\n\nrespects the symmetry between the two spin states and is also convenient in some analytical\n\ncalculations of the model that exploit the relationship (σi)2 = 1 regardless of σi [24,25]. For neuronal spike data, σ˜i ∈ {0, 1} is often used [22,26,27], whereas σi ∈ {−1, 1} is also commonly used [17,18,28,29]. For fMRI data, our previous work employed σ˜i ∈ {0, 1} [12–15]. The use of σ˜i ∈ {0, 1}\n\nin representing neuronal spike trains has a rationale in being able to express the instantaneous\n\nﬁring rate in a simple form\n\nN i=1\n\nσi\n\nand\n\nsynchronous\n\nﬁring\n\nof\n\nneurons\n\nby\n\na\n\nsimple\n\nmultiplication\n\n[30]. For example, three neurons simultaneously ﬁre if and only if σ1σ2σ3 = 1.

Results\n(a) Accuracy of the three methods\nWe applied the three methods to estimate the pairwise MEM to resting-state fMRI signals recorded from two healthy adult individuals in the Human Connectome Project. We extracted ROIs from three brain systems, i.e. default mode network (DMN, NROI = 12), fronto-parietal network (FPN, NROI = 11) and cingulo-opercular network (CON, NROI = 7), using the ROIs whose coordinates were identiﬁed previously [31]. We had tmax = 9560 volumes in total.\nThe estimated parameter values are compared between likelihood maximization and pseudolikelihood maximization in ﬁgure 2a–f. For all the networks, the results obtained by the pseudo-likelihood maximization are close to those obtained by the likelihood maximization, in particular for J. The results obtained by the likelihood maximization and those obtained by the minimum probability ﬂow are compared in ﬁgure 2g–j for the DMN and FPN. We did not apply the minimum probability ﬂow method to the CON because all of the 28 activity patterns appeared at least once, i.e. D = Ω, which made the right-hand side of equation (2.15) zero.

By contrast, I2/IN exceeded unity because S1 > SN > S2 for the minimum probability ﬂow method.\n\n(b) Disconnectivity graphs\nFigure 3 shows the disconnectivity graph of the DMN, FPN and CON, calculated for the parameter values estimated by likelihood maximization. The two synchronized activity patterns, i.e. the activity patterns with all ROIs being active or inactive, were local minimums. The FPN had much more local minimums than the DMN and CON did. Although the present results are opposite to our previous results using a different dataset [14], the reason for the discrepancy is unclear.\n\n(c) Effects of the data length\nOur experiences suggest that, as the number of ROIs, N, increases, the pairwise MEM seems to demand a large amount of data to realize a high accuracy. If we use N ROIs, there are 2N\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 22 August 2023\naccuracy, r\n\nrsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

However, the MEM assigns a positive probability to such an unvisited pattern. Even if an activity pattern σ is realized by the empirical data a few times, the empirical distribution, Pempirical(σ ), would not be reliable because it is evaluated only based on a few visits to σ (divided by tmax). If tmax is much larger and σ is visited proportionally many times, then we would be able to estimate Pempirical(σ ) more accurately. This exercise led us to hypothesize that the accuracy scales as a function of tmax/2N.\nTo examine this point, we carried out likelihood maximization on the fMRI data of varying length (tmax/20 ≤ ≤ tmax) and calculated r (which coincides with I2/IN for the maximumlikelihood estimator). For a given , we calculated r for each of the tmax − datasets of length , i.e. {σ (1), . . . , σ ( )}, {σ (2), . . . , σ ( + 1)}, . . ., {σ (tmax − + 1), . . . , σ (tmax)}. The average and standard deviation of r as a function of /2N are shown in ﬁgure 4a for the DMN, FPN and CON. As expected, the accuracy improved as increased. The results for the DMN, FPN and CON roughly collapsed on a single curve. The ﬁgure suggests that, to achieve an accuracy of 0.8 and 0.9, each activity pattern should be visited ≈5 and ≈16 times on average, respectively.\nBecause the aforementioned sampling method used overlapping time windows to make different samples strongly depend on each other, we carried out the same test by dividing the entire time series {σ (1), . . . , σ (tmax)} into two halves of length = tmax/2, four quarters of length\n= tmax/4, eight non-overlapping samples of length = tmax/8 and so forth. The results (ﬁgure 4b) were similar to those in the case of overlapping time windows (ﬁgure 4a).\n4. Discussion\nWe explained a set of computational methods to estimate the pairwise MEM and energy landscapes from resting-state fMRI data. Novel components, as compared with our previous methods [12–15], were the pseudo-likelihood maximization, the minimum probability ﬂow and a variant of the Dijkstra method to calculate the disconnectivity graph. We applied the methods to fMRI data collected from healthy participants and assessed the amount of data needed to secure a sufﬁcient accuracy of ﬁt.\nThe present results suggest that the current method is admittedly demanding in terms of the amount of data, although the results should be corroborated with different datasets. In the application of the pairwise MEM to neuronal spike trains, the data length does not seem to pose a severe limit if the network size, N, is comparable to those in this study. This is because one typically uses a high time resolution to ensure that there are no multiple spikes within a time window (e.g. 2 ms [28], 10 ms [22], 20 ms [17,18,27]). Then, the number of data points, tmax,\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 22 August 2023\n\nrsta.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

In fMRI experiments, the interval\n\n12\n\nbetween two measurements, called the repetition time (TR), is typically 2–4 s, and a participant in\n\nthe resting state (or a particular task condition) can be typically scanned for 5–15 min. Then, we\n\nwould have tmax = 75–450, with which we can reliably estimate the pairwise MEM model up to N ≈ 5 (ﬁgure 4), which is small. If we pool fMRI data from 10 participants belonging to the same\n\ngroup to estimate one MEM, we would have tmax = 750–4500, accommodating N ≈ 8. This is an\n\nimportant limitation of our approach. Currently we cannot apply the method to relatively large\n\nbrain systems (i.e. those with a larger number of ROIs), let alone voxel-based data.\n\nWe demonstrated the methods with fMRI data obtained from healthy participants. The same\n\nmethods can be applied to different conditions of human participants including the case of\n\nmedical applications, the topic of the present theme issue. Various neuropsychiatric disorders\n\nhave been suggested to have dynamical footprints in the brain [1–4]. Altered dynamics in the\n\nbrain at various spatial and time scales may result in deformation of energy landscapes as\n\ncompared with healthy controls.\n\n5. Material and methods\n(a) Data and participants\nWe used resting-state fMRI data publicly shared in the Human Connectome Project (acquisition Q10 in release S900 of the WU-Minn HCP data) [32]. The data were collected using a 3T MRI (Skyra, Siemens) with an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR, 0.72 s; TE, 33.1 ms; 72 slices; 2.0 mm isotopic; ﬁeld of view, 208 × 180 mm) and T1-weighted sequence (TR, 2.4 s; TE, 2.14 ms; 0.7 mm isotopic; ﬁeld of view, 224 × 224 mm). The EPI data were recorded in four runs (≈15 min run−1) while participants were instructed to relax while looking at a ﬁxed cross mark on a dark screen.\nWe used such EPI and T1 images recorded from two adult participants (one female; 22–25 years old), because the amount of the data was sufﬁciently large for the current analysis.\n\n(b) Preprocessing and extraction of region of interest data\nWe preprocessed the EPI data in essentially the same manner as the conventional methods that we previously used for resting-state fMRI data [12,33,34] with SPM12 (www.ﬁl.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Brieﬂy, after discarding the ﬁrst ﬁve images in each run, we conducted realignment, unwarping, slice timing correction, normalization to the standard template (ICBM 152) and spatial smoothing (full-width at half maximum = 8 mm). Afterwards, we removed the effects of head motion, white matter signals and cerebrospinal ﬂuid signals by a general linear model. Finally, we performed temporal band-pass ﬁltering (0.01–0.1 Hz) and obtained resting-state whole-brain data.\nWe then extracted a time series of fMRI signals from each ROI. The ROIs were deﬁned as 4 mm spheres around their centre whose coordinates were determined in a previous study [31]. The signals at each ROI were those averaged over the sphere. In total, we obtained time-series data of length tmax = 9560 at 30 ROIs (12 in the DMN, 11 in the FPN and 7 in the CON).\nAuthors’ contributions.
