Accelerated TMS (aTMS) protocols address these burdens and attempt to increase the efficiency of standard TMS. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine accelerated TMS studies for depressive disorders in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies with full text publications available in English describing more than one session of TMS (repetitive or theta burst stimulation) per day. Studies describing accelerated TMS protocols for conditions other than depression or alternative neuromodulation methods, preclinical studies, and neurophysiology studies regarding transcranial stimulation were excluded. Eighteen articles describing eleven distinct studies (seven publications described overlapping samples) met eligibility criteria. A Hedges’ g effect size and confidence intervals were calculated. The summary analysis of three suitable randomized control trials revealed a cumulative effect size of 0.39 (95% CI 0.005–0.779). A separate analysis including open-label trials and active arms of suitable RCTs revealed a g of 1.27 (95% CI 0.902–1.637). Overall, the meta-analysis suggested that aTMS improves depressive symptom severity. In general, study methodologies were acceptable, but future efforts could enhance sham techniques and blinding. \nIntroduction \n \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and chronic condition, affecting more than 300 million people. It is a leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease (World Health Organization, 2018). MDD is also highly prevalent; in the U.S., approximately 10.4% of adults have suffered from MDD in the past 12 months, and 20.6% experience MDD in a lifetime (Hasin et al., 2018). In addition to poor quality of life, MDD is associated with increased mortality rates, with one of the most important causes being suicide (Mathew, 2008). Mortality due to suicide in depression is a major public health concern. Every year, more than 800,000 people die from suicide worldwide; this roughly corresponds to one death every 40 seconds (World Health Organization, 2014). Recent literature highlighted that U.S. suicide rates have increased by 30% since 1999 (Stone et al., 2018). Thus, the development of effective, accessible interventions for MDD is a high priority for improving public health. \n \nFirst-line, evidence-based treatment options for MDD include psychopharmacology and psychotherapeutic approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy. However, often depressive symptoms are refractory to these treatment options. Approximately 20–30% of patients continue to experience pervasive depressive symptoms despite adequate trials of medication and psychotherapy (Rush et al., 2006). Prior antidepressant resistance also decreases the likelihood of responding to subsequent interventions (Rush et al., 2006). Because of the high prevalence of treatment resistance and the challenges with conventional therapeutic options for MDD, effective second-line treatments are of paramount importance. Neuromodulation modalities such as electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are options for treatment-resistant depression. \n \nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an evidence-based treatment for MDD (Lefaucheur et al., 2014, McClintock et al., 2018). Typically, rTMS protocols for MDD deliver 10 Hz stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) over 4–6 weeks in once-daily stimulation sessions. Patients typically receive four or more weeks of treatment for symptomatic improvement, and dosing is not personalized. Generally, for left, prefrontal, high-frequency (HF) rTMS, the response rates are 20–30% (Avery et al., 2008, George et al., 2010, O'Reardon et al., 2007). A meta-analysis also suggested that standard rTMS protocols involving HF-rTMS demonstrated numbers needed to treat of 8 and 6 to achieve clinical remission and clinical response, respectively (Berlim et al., 2014). \n \nNovel dosing approaches have the prospect of optimizing the response and remission rates of TMS (De Raedt et al., 2015, Gross et al., 2007). Standard rTMS is also seldom useful in acutely suicidal patients because of the delayed time-to-response. The daily administration schedule over several weeks is another barrier limiting its feasibility for patients who work full time or have transportation challenges. Hence, consolidating the treatment to a few days could increase the utility of TMS in both inpatient and intensive outpatient program settings. \n \nAccelerated TMS (aTMS) protocols with both rTMS and theta burst stimulation (TBS) are increasingly under study to address the practical limitations of conventional daily rTMS for MDD. TBS is a newer form of rTMS which mimics endogenous hippocampal theta patterns (Huang et al., 2005), and may have comparable efficacy to standard rTMS in treating depression (Blumberger et al., 2018). The rationale for an accelerated approach is based on two major principles: first, the presumption that equal or greater effects are induced by the repeated application of stimulation within a short time interval; and second, that the effects induced within densely scheduled sessions have durable efficacy (Fitzgerald, 2013). In addition, accelerated response to treatment (within days) is a theoretical advantage of aTMS protocols. Previous neurophysiologic evidence suggests that a greater effect of rTMS on cortical excitability is achieved if a second rTMS session is provided within 24 hours of the first session (Maeda et al., 2000). Other research proposed a dose (number of stimuli) – response relationship for rTMS (George, 2010). \n \nAlthough there is much interest in aTMS protocols for depression, little is known about the efficacy and tolerability. In view of this important knowledge gap, we aimed to systematically review existing studies of aTMS for depression. Systematic data on study designs, treatment protocols, efficacy, and tolerability would have utility for both clinical and research communities. We anticipated that existing aTMS studies would have variable treatment parameters, treatment schedules, study quality, and outcome data. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the cumulative effect size for the treatment of depression with l -DLPFC aTMS. \nSection snippets \nMethods \n \nA systematic review of the literature on aTMS protocols in patients with depressive disorders was executed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Liberati et al., 2009). This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (ID number: CRD42018092258). \nOverview \n \nA total of 18 publications from 11 unique studies (6 randomized controlled trials and 5 open-label trials) met inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). Stimulation parameters and sample characteristics are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Ten publications meeting inclusion criteria were derived from shared samples; 4 from a larger rTMS study (Baeken et al., 2013, Baeken et al., 2014, Baeken et al., 2015, Baeken et al., 2017b), 4 from a larger intermittent TBS (iTBS) study (Baeken et al., \nDiscussion \n \nOpen-label and randomized studies have examined aTMS for the treatment of depression. Initial findings suggest that accelerated approaches may have utility for addressing the practical limitations of standard TMS and optimizing the dosing of TMS. These existing studies serve a critical role in demonstrating the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of aTMS. However, the number of studies to date is small, and thus the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis must be interpreted with \nConclusions \n \nTMS is now widely available for the clinical treatment of depression. However, standard rTMS treatment protocols have limitations in efficacy and present pragmatic barriers for many patients. Novel and optimized dosing schedules may address these limitations and provide opportunities for precision medicine approaches for TMS delivery. Protocols with aTMS are one example, and existing preliminary work suggests that these compact treatment schedules are safe, tolerable, and feasible.
